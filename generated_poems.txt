flittering

Bring with passion
like a sker in the old of such and Crepts thron
Scattcr blows that I should beguile
the shaft of his gaze with a bow.
He is not prisoner of the world, fettered to this world of earth,
that I should beguile him with gold of the kingdom of the world.
He is an angel, though in form he is a man; he is not lustful
that I should beguile him with enchantment of grain and loss.
He is not veiled that I should make myself out sick and utter
sighs, to beguile him with lamentation.
In this house of mud and water,
my heart has fallen to the Wind brings,
And if no create to Written of Life.
