Pass around the cup fair maiden

Pass around the cup fair maiden, 
Because Love seemed easy at first, 
But now I see how difficult it is. 
The hearts of Lovers bleed, 
and will be doomed to break, 
when the scent of the Beloved blows away in the wind. 
How can the traveller stay safe 
when the clarion calls its sound of parting? 
The Master tells us: 
"soak your prayer rug red with wine, my friend". 
Those who are still on the shore 
feel they have peace of mind, 
they don't know our storms and dark nights. 
But at last, I find the Secret, 
hidden in street corners, 
revealed before me. 
Hafiz, enjoy her Love 
And instruct her, 
"suffer the darkness for the sake of the light".

If the Shirazi Turk would only grant my heart's desire

If the Shirazi Turk would only grant my heart's desire, 
I'd give up Samarkand and Bukhara for the poorest part of her. 
Fair maiden, serve all of the old Wine now, 
if you wait for paradise 
you won't find drinking partners such as these! 
The heavenly musicians play well, 
Like plundering Turks, 
they have plundered all my patience. 
For my poor love has been rejected by my Beloved, 
Before my Beloved's beauty, 
my talk of "love" is like an insult. 
My Beloved is as beautiful as Joseph, 
My Beloved's Love strong enough to enchant Zulaikha. 
I long for you, even as your words of rejection 
still sound in the air; 
Anything sounds sweet, if your lips say it. 
Enjoy Wine and Music in every moment, 
O fortunate young people, heed the advice of Hafiz!

Zephyr, reach my charming gazelle and say

Zephyr, reach my charming gazelle and say: 
because of you I've wandered through hill and desert, 
look kindly on my excitement and awe, 
favour me with your sweet divine lips! 
You're so proud of your roselike charm, 
that you will never think to ask of your nightingale. 
Wise birds cannot be caught by tricks or cunning, 
only by gentle good-tempered Love. 
Anyone who harps on their beauty and charm 
Hides a lack of loyalty, friendship, true devotion.
When you enjoy drinks with your caring friends, 
Remember my love, consider my true feeling. 
There's no loyalty found in mere appearances. 
But Hafiz, your sweet sincere songs 
can move the Angels themselves.

My heart is going wild

My heart is going wild! 
Help me, o masters! 
My secret love becomes revealed for all time! 
We are broken boats, 
you will not help us wind, move on, 
perhaps you'll be more useful to a friend. 
The love of this world lasts only a few days. 
It is all fantasy and sentiment. 
Be good to your friends, 
while you still have the chance. 
"how badly I want the morning's drink", 
said the nightingale last evening, 
while surrounded by sweet flowers. 
Be grateful for the blessings you have, 
fortunate man! 
Help the poor mystic as much as you're able. 
There is happiness in heaven and earth, 
if only two creeds are followed: 
"Be just to your friend, 
make peace with your foe". 
And if you have never reached the houses of fame and fortune, 
Admit that you cannot change what is written. 
When you feel miserable and self-pitying, 
Drink wine, and take pleasure, 
in this way the pauper can find the richest secret.
The cup of wine is like the mirror of Alexander, 
through it he took the kingdom of Darius. 
Forgive me o well-dressed Priest, 
It is the will of Allah, if my cloth is smeared with wine.

Come, fair maiden

Come, fair maiden! 
And bring us pure Wine 
to help us forget the sufferings of time. 
Help us throw off the cloak of falseness and its ways, 
I don't care to be respected, 
though it does no harm to those who are truly wise.
The flame of my burning heart 
has burnt away all poorer hearts 
with its bright rays of good. 
My love-crazy heart cries out, saying: 
"Who can I tell the divine secret to?" 
I enjoy the divine company of my Beloved, 
Even though my Beloved 
has taken away all my peace of mind. 
The cypress, the flowers, and all work of art, 
They mean nothing to me, 
now that my Beloved has given me this gift. 
O Hafiz, suffer the challenge, and be wise. 
You are destined to find your home.

Good news, lovely nightingale

Good news, lovely nightingale! 
The garden is filled with life again! 
Warm wind, when you fly along the pastures, 
send word to the delicate flowers: 
"I will stay forever at the door of the tavern, 
because the serving-girl is too beautiful to miss, 
Beloved! I have lost myself in lovesickness for you, 
In your heart I sail as safely as in Noah's Ark" 
Those who condemn the drinkers 
will lose all their piousness and beliefs

Brother believers

Brother believers, 
whatever shall we do? 
The priest left the mosque 
for the tavern yesterday! 
How can the believers 
turn to Mecca to pray? 
When our Mullah 
turns to the tavern instead?! 
The joy of the Beloved is insane, 
we are madmen 
trapped in the curls of her hair. 
It was written 
that we would find this life 
All is written, 
and our lives prove this. 
The face of the beloved is grace, 
When I see it, 
I can see nothing but beauty around me. 
Does the fire of my sighs 
And the flame of the beloved's shadow in me 
Affect your stony hearts? 
I had wondered if it might!

time and space! 
How can anything stand against such power?

Fair maiden, make bright our cups with wine

Fair maiden, make bright our cups with wine, 
call for the singers,

O you who are ignorant of the bliss of wine:

because in the cup I see the Friend's reflection. 
In the Book of Life, my name is eternal. 
No one dies who's heart is on fire with Love. 
warm wind, if you ever fly past the Friend say: 
"Why should I try to forget my name? 
There will come a time when you, too, will forget it!" 
It is good to find peace in the eyes of the Friend,
for that reason I drink wine. 
The "clean foods" of the Priest,

I think they'll earn the same. 
But Hafiz; wipe your tears,

The beauty of your face, my Beloved

The beauty of your face, my Beloved, 
strikes my heart like a piercing arrow. 
Before creation existed, there was Love. 
Love is the greatest work of the Divine. 
Narcissus found love only by happenstance, 
and Helen's eyes caused wars by a mere gaze. 
But when I wandered last night 
through the garden, 
The budding flowers reminded me of your lips. 
The wind-blown violets, fresh and joyous 
brought my memory back to the beauty of your curls.
Now I wash my cloak in clear wine, 
no man can escape what is Written. 
Hafiz: endure love, and you'll succeed, 
if you admit that this is what is Written. 
The whole world now turns to the desire of my heart, 
because I have become sincere 
in my devotion to the Beloved.

The Friend's Love sets my heart afire

The Friend's Love sets my heart afire, 
and this fire burns my entire being. 
My body wasted away from the separation from the Friend, 
My soul wastes away! 
What is the purpose of Love? 
Even the candles feel sorry for my suffering, 
I burn more than they do. 
All my beliefs are tested by the wine of the tavern, 
All of my notions are washed away by it! 
When I tried to put aside the cup, 
it was cause for regret, 
My heart aches without wine! 
Come close, Friend, and speak Truth, 
I seek out your gaze, 
painful as it is for me.

the candle has burnt through the night,

Where is that killer of lusts to be found? 
Though it is a dark night,

All who have entered this world will leave it. 
If so, why take things so seriously in the tavern? 
Look to my Beloved's curls and gaze, 
if you want to know where my heart is kept. 
The musicians, the serving maid, and the wine

Do not look at the Lovers and say

"those are mistaken", 
You are not qualified to judge them, child. 
What is there, when I'm with myself? 
The more still I become, the louder it sounds. 
All the joy of life doesn't matter at all to me, 
Except when my Beloved's beauty shines in it, 
like the Sun. 
The monks and nuns are soaked in the blood of hearts 
they've murdered, 
I pray that one day they cleanse themselves with wine. 
I'm respected at the fire-altars of heathens, 
because the fire that burns forever is within me.

This has stayed in my heart. 
Last night, your love-note came to me,

Beloved, I think of you always! 
Your sweet-smelling curls wake up my lonesome soul.

The only sin is to claim not to care about loving you. 
The pucker of your lips transmits a secret truth: 
Thousands of Lovers have fallen deep in this abyss.
Misfortune and and smallness have kept me from you,
I could not reach your embrace soon enough. 
Tell the gatekeeper of the heart 
to let in the honest Lover.

With sadness of voice my Beloved says to me: 
"You seek sleep, my Lover? Shame on you! 
To drink at midnight takes great discipline, 
or in Love's eyes you will be a sinner!" 
O arrogant Priests! Drinkers are not the evil ones,
their place was Written since the beginning of time!

For there to be Love, selfishness cannot exist. 
Just be True, because Truth makes your words shine.
Insincerity will darken the most beautiful of faces.

When I long for you, I don't want wine

When I long for you, I don't want wine,

Even if its the wine of heaven,

Wine has no purpose if the Beloved is not there. 
Alas! 
The Friend is gone and cannot speak with me of the Beloved, 
now nothing interests my tear-filled eyes. 
Beware my eyes, 
I am a danger to others, 
with the same flood of tears and sentiment that drown 
me. 
The Friend spends his time freely with others, 
But with a stranger like me he keeps hidden.

Come now, don't depend on the house of chance

Come now, don't depend on the house of chance, 
Serve wine to all you see, your life will soon be done. 
I'm the slave of Him, under one sky, 
who is entirely free of all attachment. 
Last night I was in the tavern, 
Drunk and making merry, 
I heard the Djinn bring good news: 
"Ambitious falcon, 
don't think yourself grand for flying high, 
Your nest is a home to sorrow and grief. 
The minaret of heaven cries out: 
"This material trap is too small to be worthy of you"" 
Remember my son; don't fret over sorrows, 
over the passing concerns of what is and may come. 
"enough with your moping!" says the inner voice, 
"Find happiness in the moment, 
for there is nothing else." 
Don't chase after the future or cling to the present, 
Too many have taken this false hag for their bride.
There's no percentage in wanting a rose to bloom forever, 
The heartless nightingale's call lasts only an eve.
And do not envy Hafiz's poetry, 
it is only borrowed from the Creator of all things!

And I can visit it whenever I need to. 
Inside we drink barrels-full of wine,

The "beloved" you see is a being full of vanity and intrigue, 
But in me you'll find simplicity and sincerity. 
I can tell my Beloved the secrets 
that I would never dare to tell anyone else. 
Since I gazed in the beloved's face, 
I can find no greater bliss or happiness. 
The beloved is Mecca,

The rose looks like dark wine

The rose looks like dark wine, 
The nightingale sings its praises. 
Wander through the fields with the book of Love, 
This isn't the time for giving lectures! 
The drunken judge proclaimed last night: 
"Drinking is wickedness and embezzlement is wrong!"
The wine is Written for you, but not for long. 
Enjoy the wine and the musicians while you can. 
Or worry about looking pious and of good reputation, 
hide from people and the world. 
Being a Priest is good business after all; 
Pretending to be pious earns priests more money

Speaking wise words without showing wise actions

In the eye of wisdom, all the goals of this world

Without you my heart aches. 
Only death separates me from the Friend.
