Abc Of Terror 

Did the CIA tell the FBI that it knows the work of the IRA?
Just as the RCMP confused the PLO with Al-Quaieda?
The biggest weapon of terror is alphabetic confusion,
It blends together ignorance, fanaticism with dogmatic infusion.
For the homeless, poor and hungry, there is basic need,
To the yammering of the privileged and rich they do not heed.
Food and medicine for all is delayed by poor distribution,
Itâ€™s waylaid by the mighty against retribution.
Itâ€™s hardly a wonder the worldâ€™s a more dangerous place,
That the rich and famous try to escape into space.
But the Almighty knows who deserves to be here,
And itâ€™s not the humble and poor, who have something to fear.

Abc 

Can I break tradition?
Will it be okay?
I'll ruin your mission,
'Cause I want a say
In this life of mine
I have no control
The voice of the divine
Speaks to my soul
Trapped in a position
To act against my will
This is the worst condition
That makes you want to kill
I don't want to be you

A B C 

The ABC was our song, we'd hummed it together
the night we'd met. We couldn't believe we knew it too.
Then the plastic snail came along with its Hawking recording -
we rolled him to the cat tray on his yellow wheels.
Together we sang the melodic sequins of it opening
the ups & downs of each cadence Aaa Bee Cee Dee Eee Fff Ggg
and stuck with it through the military rattle of l,m,n,o,p,
to where it begins to fall apart in Tourette's phonetics
and never recovers. The â€˜and' between â€˜Y and Z'
is an affront to the tonally deaf. It becomes like jazz
- in its aleatory nonsense - and we fuckin hated jazz.
But I loved that song, I thought it was ours.

I got to â€˜Aâ€™ and was assaulted and abused
And attacked and ambushed and anger was used
And acute agony left me anxious and bemused
Then went to â€˜Bâ€™ and got bloodied and battered
And burnt and bashed and bruises were scattered
And beaten and bones were broken and shattered
I then gave up when a friend told me

Abc 

You sit left to me,
You don't wanna see,
What's really inside me.
Do you want to hurt me?
You could tell it everyone!
Would it make you feel better?
You don't know anything about me.
My new name for you is 'ABC'
I don't need lipstick for attention,
I also never owned extentions.
The only problem I ever had was you
and what you used to do.
And the last thing I tell you about me,
is why you're so much weaker than me:
You only blance on a tightrope that's lying on the floor,
I'm doing the same but over a huge gorge.

Just Abc Of Language 

When education becomes business, it loses value;
That too technical education after becoming so,
Manufactures products of degree holders sans no
Hope of future and knowledge to stand on one's legs!
Not knowing history and world's future, these technicians
Sans general knowledge too, don't know how to change
Their attitude and try their level best in some other line,
When the particular line of job becomes out of reach ever!
Caught in the quagmire, they become depressed due to
Their obsession and roam around as lunatics not knowing
Where they stand and where they have to go in this world
To achieve their aim and get fulfilment in the course of time!
Whatever be the education, it is just the ABC of language;
Using it with creative ability only, one can shine in any field!

In the landscape of your mind, one has the ability to think clearly.
Never allowing deep, dark thoughts to penetrate.
Spirited, beautiful and heavenly thoughts tickle the senses.
Piercing through delicate walls,  giving strength to stand  tall.
Instead of accepting negative views from those of low self esteem.
Realize you are in charge of every thought held within.
Always start each day in a positive light.
Thinking, of Godâ€™s wondrous gifts, His beauty in sight.
In the quiet of the noon day sun,   a new day has begun.
On top of  mountains high, sitting calmly while  birds fly by.
Never leaving  your mind untouched by Godâ€™s beauty.
Always covered like a glove,  by the blood of the lamb.

riting in an alphabetic script, in which the first letter, 
syllable or word of each line, paragraph or other recurring feature in the text spells out a word or a message.
Far down South China Sea
Indigenous brave men and women lives
Loyal, friendly, fearless happy people
Ingenious and not to be outsmarted
Pearl of the orient no other else in Asia
Islands nurtured by Mother Nature and its wonders
Not to fear surrender its freedom and liberty
Only to die and ready to struggle to self-determination
Race to economic prosperity
Ace of democracy and ingenuity
Challenges to fight back in defense of its sovereignty
Echoes people power through out the world

Acrostic 

Little maidens, when you look
On this little story-book,
Reading with attentive eye
Its enticing history,
Never think that hours of play
Are your only HOLIDAY,
And that in a HOUSE of joy
Lessons serve but to annoy:
If in any HOUSE you find
Children of a gentle mind,
Each the others pleasing ever--
Each the others vexing never--
Daily work and pastime daily
In their order taking gaily--
Then be very sure that they
Have a life of HOLIDAY.

A Graduation Day Poem Acrostic 

Happy Graduation Day to you!
At last you've completed this journey.
Preparing for a long time you've
Pursued what you've dreamed for and now
You are going on your way up
Greater things are waiting for you and
Really you are on your way now
And there's a more in the future for you to do and your
Dad and your mom must be very proud of you
Use your talents well and be the best you can be, remember
All that you have done to get where you're now
This is not the end but it's just the beginning for you so
Inspire others you meet on your way out to do the same and
Open the door of your heart and
Never quit dreaming but hold on tight to your hopes 'cause
Day after day there are more things to do and learn
And remember to be honest and true to you because...
You can make all your dreams come true one day too
Happy Graduation Day to you!

Elizabeth it is in vain you say
'Love not' â€” thou sayest it in so sweet a way:
In vain those words from thee or L. E. L.
Zantippe's talents had enforced so well:
Ah! if that language from thy heart arise,
Breathe it less gently forth â€” and veil thine eyes.

To cure his love â€” was cured of all beside â€”
His folly â€” pride â€” and passion â€” for he died.

Overly hurt and utterly disgusted
Very sickening feelings flood my mind.
Every thing I thought I knew, I now question
Ready to give up and say enough is enough!

Every Flower Acrostic 

Every flower that blooms withers
Very true is the tale,
Even the brightest and the pale;
Rich in softness, fragrance, beauty and colors
Yet they give out pleasure to others
Fresher they bloom, duller they wither;
Look at their wonderful journey
Only once they bloom, yet they live on
Within the minds of all, as recollection
Even after many years, as honey
Rightly are they GOD's best creation!

Untimely end has come for all

Aid is needed everywhere
Courage is needed in the hopeless
Time passes slowly, too slow

Rich and poor people suffer the same
Running away has become normal
Our lives are destroyed

He gave forgiveness for all who repent
In His great Mercy paid it all at Calvary
Sacrificed so perfect,  Grace touched you and me.
How can one receive the Gift so pure?
Each one can take it from His Word
All who turn away from sin are sure
Love and peace His Grace pours forth
In all of that He reigns as LORD
New creations only He can promise
God is Faithful and He will do this.
God gives new life as you turn to Him
Restoration and healing He alone can give
Almighty and eternal is your God within
Christ said you will not perish but eternally live.
Everything God said is true...so believe!

Hospital Acrostic Sonnet 

Dull grey cabinets, posters on the wall,
Overalls in grubby white passing through the hall,
Stretcher beds, beige, blue, seating for a few,
The white welcome posts do duty all year through.
Awaiting diagnoses, anxious patients call,
Yet information filters slowly, at a crawl.
Patience, a virtue, tried and tested too,
Applies elastic strings to Time, judgements askew.
Through age, illness, accident, Death nets all.
Independence? â€“ truly few retain the wherewithal.
Every day brings query, quandary adds to
New isolation, illness, tests as wills unglue.
Count all your blessings, be life fine or squall,
Each soon accounts must render, with Deathâ€™s pall.

I Will Stand By You In Acrostic 

I will stand by you until; the sands of time, stand still -
Without you my world would just crumble and fade away
It is heaven when I hold you, each embrace is such a thrill
Lost in thoughts of you, your on my mind both night and day
Love like ours I am thankful for and I pray our love will stay
Standing by your side I shall, in sunshine or in rain
Through my life '' I will stand by you '' there I shall remain
As our love grows, like the pretty flowers do in spring
Never ending perfumed bouquets of love, to you I'll bring
Divine is our romance, to me your love means everything
Being with you my angel, I've shed only happy tears
Your loves a part of me, that I'll treasure through the years
You are all I ever longed for my paradise of dreams, it seems
Only your love could bring this all about. I will stand by you
Until the last grain of sand, in the hourglass of time runs out

Misty Mountain Mirage An Acrostic 

Mountainous terrain steep
In the Tibetan plateau, where the
Sky almost
Touches the horizon
Yonder, with the
Mist moving up from the vale below,
Over the tall pine-trees and thick foliage,
Uniting the clouds from above
Naturally, and blocking the visual acuity of
The tired, trekking mountaineers on their
Arduous route down the mountain slopes,
In the intense heat of the rising sun,
Notwithstanding the many
Miles of shrubs and undergrowth that lie ahead, looking
Impossible to even the expert climber, who is momentarily
Relieved and excited by the mirage of an old castle
Appearing suddenly from nowhere,
Giving a â€˜de ja vuâ€™ feeling to all up there
Eyeing the beauty of the ancient masonry.

Lips like twin lotus buds just made to kiss,
Eyes clear and still like pools in which I lose
No time but dive within to sink or swim,
To lose all sense of time and place. I choose

No matter what you wish Iâ€™ll gladly do
Except give up, or go, or be untrue.

For you my dear, hold what simple Crimson cannot.

K.G.B. and C.I.A. destroyed, -
Remnants of a world which once enjoyed
A game of catch as catch can coalition.
Idea[l]s are bent beyond all recognition,
New capitalâ€™s towards the East decoyed,
Enterprise unbridled, unalloyed:
Uncertain is Manâ€™s future, world in fission.
Kiev opportunity:  ambition
Rises with the rate that unemployed
Are added to the rolls.  Few will avoid
Impending challenge, fewer have volition.
Now, with the New Year knocking on the door,
Expect in time change none have dreamed before.

Valentines Day An Acrostic 

Victory to all hearts at love;
Amazing words of love exchange;
Love fills the air everywhere;
E-mails sent in lovely hues and tones of love;
No oneâ€™s exempt from loveâ€™s phenomenon;
The whole world celebrates â€˜loverâ€™s day, â€™
In gaiety, romanticism and togetherness;
No one need covet persons at love;
Every person needs a lovely time;
â€™
Say, â€˜I love youâ€™ to someone, if you can.
Dance and sing to tunes of love;
Awaken emotions in Cupidâ€™s style;
You are a valentine on earth to someone!

War Memories With Acrostic 

Memories woven to monument towering to heaven
Of a sweet, gracious and wonderful woman.
Though she did nothing wrong, she was persecuted
Held daughter and son in arms, her man was deported.
Edgy at the brickyard, hurt in Jewish pride
Rascals put her in a jammed freight car for a railway ride.
Weary from thirst and hunger, surrounded by pain
Horror was unfolding on a rattling train.
Exhausted of the ordeal she arrived at the camps
Robbed of her freedom she stood under the lamps
Exposed to blowing snow, the barracks lacked ovens.
A small vulnerable woman there had seen forehand
Ruthless degradations, beastly atrocities offhand.
Experienced nightmare while the sun was shining
Yet hope knocked the door when bombs were falling.
Overwhelmed by explosions, frightened, panic-stricken
Unprotected against the blasts, she shielded her children.

Water Acrostic 

Water is my favourite drink,
At times the best thing to quench a thirst
That comes to me suddenly,
Even though it's abundantly available
Refined, pure specimens are sold in shops.

Why Acrostic 

Acrostic poetry
conceals a word
read it repeatedly
on every first sentence
soon you'll know the secret
the theme reveals the word
in every first letter of the line
can see who/what the poem about

Writings A Tonic The Poems Acrostic 

Writing's a tonic, yes, indeed!
Relaxing to the mind!
In times of stress, in times of need,
To help you to unwind!
In truth, the pen is mightier!
No doubt at all in this...
God knows our meanings must be clear
Succinct won't go amiss!
A gentle word, a piece of prose,
Triumphant themes and more,
Opinions sought, meant to propose,
Not easy to ignore!
I've done my part, this much is true...
Calligraphy's now up to YOU!

My Love For You Alexandrine Poetry 

Your love for me a little more than nothing means,
When love as sense of self may be, than mine, less strong.
The thrill of love may keep its paint on withered greens.
A night of dreams is like a sad and jerking song.
Your silence dances meaningâ€™s words on faceâ€™s frown,
My eyes of winter watch the stream of light on high,
Emotions are a flow of words, while stripping down
Their sense of love to sound like a sad â€˜â€™good byeâ€™â€™.
With red unfolded kisses thrilling white delight,
The moon replaces missing sun with all around.
It makes me dance my will  in dreamsâ€™ abstract on height.
It makes me feel the love again and heals my wound.

My Yahwehs Praises An Alexandrine 

The earth speaks of your discerning and stern glory:
Speaking the language human couldn't comprehend:
The wind telling the leafs to go on pilgrimage,
The leafs in turn taking picnic on the tried earth.
The waves flee at the pronouncement of your great name:
even that name that breaks through every generations.
Like the calf does everest flee at your presence,
Afraid of the entourages preceeding you.
The wind howl at your order speaking through his nose.
All nature tells the beauty of your holiness.
Fishes, trees, ridges, reefs, sheol and the pompous sea.
All adhere to the laws of your soveriegnty.
Say along with me, all breath, my Yahweh's praises.

Natural Thrill Alexandrine Poetry 

The sun can rise again, the moon bitterly sleeps.
Nor friend nor foe tonight, the day merrily calls.
The trees, the grass, the lakes, their lip tenderly keeps
The moonlight kiss, when night in dreams carefully falls.
The stars still dance all dreams with grace in their light twist.
In trees, the wind may swing the true changeable greens
To shake and wake the flower buds' murmuring mist,
When love as sense of self for him turpitude means.

Seasons Alexandrine 

Spring we started planting, after tilling the ground
Summerâ€™s blissful weather, natureâ€™s beauties resound
Tiny seedlings hatching, now grow towards the sun
Growing ever skyward, their growing nearly done
Summerâ€™s growing season, its sights and smells and sound
Natureâ€™s blessed harvest, brought in from all around
Autumnâ€™s pleasant bounty, gathered from all the fields
Over until next year, winterâ€™s coldness soon yields.
Nature has done her best, she has given her all
Coming hibernation, at the end of the fall
Wearily now waiting, knowing winterâ€™s approach
Nature starts to wind down, at winters rude encroach
Now the ground is icy, snow drifting in the hedge
Waiting for the springtime, to cut winterâ€™s cruel edge
Shortened daylight hours, winterâ€™s darkest shadows
Slowly daylight lengthens, springtime surely follows.

Allegory A Moral Vehicle 

I had a gig-horse, and I called him Pleasure
Because on Sundays for a little jaunt
He was so fast and showy, quite a treasure;
Although he sometimes kicked and shied aslant.
I had a chaise, and christened it Enjoyment,
With yellow body and the wheels of red,
Because it was only used for one employment,
Namely, to go wherever Pleasure led.
I had a wife, her nickname was Delight:
A son called Frolic, who was never still:
Alas! how often dark succeeds to bright!
Delight was thrown, and Frolic had a spill,
Enjoyment was upset and shattered quite,
And Pleasure fell a splitter on Paine's Hill.

Allegory Of The Boat 

the boat that we are riding
towards an island
is chasing the sea and the sea
runs always faster than
where we are
until the waters hand us to
the sandy shore
when the running stops
but our minds do not just stop like that
it is not that simple
we tend to run as fast as the sea and this
thought
wanting to arrive on what we still
cannot grasp

Allegory 

It's an all too common allegory
Pressed from the hands of time
Lent out silent praised theme
Careless whispers never hard to find
With redeeming qualities fading
An elevation of angers hot glow
Bitterness is the totality it's framing
Seperating rightous victims who know
Blazing through their transparent veils
The blame is countered with denial
Running rapidly from the inner problem's core
Slowing down but for a little while
At last catching up to the blameworthy
Who brazenly sit atop  the Moon
Arrogantly still in denial
Their rude awakening is coming soon

An Allegory On The Subject Of The Tail And The Dog 

Biological drive is a hard thing to fight
And if nature has made you a male
Through your will or your crotch you are driven in life
To proverbial chasing of tail
Like a hound on a prowl finest prey you may stalk
Then get trapped being deceived by your senses
For those tails have been known to be wagging their dogs
And dispel with the strongest defenses
Then, sometimes things get tough when you're herding a bunch
You can't tell after who you are chasing
And as dust settles down, with the prize in your teeth
It's your own ass you'll be facing.

An Allegory 

The fight was over, and the battle won
A soldier, who beneath his chieftainâ€™s eye
Had done a might deed and done it well,
And done it as the world will have it doneâ€”
A stab, a curse, some quick play of the butt,
Two skulls cracked crosswise, but the colours savedâ€”
Proud of his wounds, proud of the promised cross,
Turned to his rear-rank man, who on his gun
Leant heavily apart. â€˜Ho, friend!â€™ he called,
â€˜You did not fight then: were you left behind?
I saw you not.â€™ The other turned and showed
A gapping, red-lipped wound upon his breast.
â€˜Ah,â€™ said he sadly, â€˜I was in the smoke!â€™
Threw up his arms, shivered, and fell and died.

An Allegory 

I.
A portal as of shadowy adamant
Stands yawning on the highway of the life
Which we all tread, a cavern huge and gaunt;
Around it rages an unceasing strife
Of shadows, like the restless clouds that haunt
The gap of some cleft mountain, lifted high
Into the whirlwinds of the upper sky.
II.
And many pass it by with careless tread,
Not knowing that a shadowy...
Tracks every traveller even to where the dead
Wait peacefully for their companion new;
But others, by more curious humour led,
Pause to examine;â€”these are very few,
And they learn little there, except to know
That shadows follow them whereâ€™er they go.

I Send You Here A Sort Of Allegory 

I send you here a sort of allegory,
(For you will understand it) of a soul,
A sinful soul possess'd of many gifts,
A spacious garden full of flowering weeds,
A glorious Devil, large in heart and brain,
That did love Beauty only, (Beauty seen
In all varieties of mould and mind)
And Knowledge for its beauty; or if Good,
Good only for its beauty, seeing not
That beauty, Good, and Knowledge, are three sisters
That doat upon each other, friends to man,
Living together under the same roof,
And never can be sunder'd without tears.
And he that shuts Love out, in turn shall be
Shut out from Love, and on her threshold lie
Howling in outer darkness. Not for this
Was common clay ta'en from the common earth,
Moulded by God, and temper'd with the tears
Of angels to the perfect shape of man.

And love, hanging on a breeze,
Doing a beauty of a sneeze.

My Bees An Allegory 

"O bees, sweet bees!" I said, "that nearest field
Is shining white with fragrant immortelles.
Fly swiftly there and drain those honey wells."
Then, spicy pines the sunny hive to shield,
I set, and patient for the autumn's yield
Of sweet I waited.
When the village bells
Rang frosty clear, and from their satin cells
The chestnuts leaped, rejoicing, I unsealed
My hive.
Alas! no snowy honey there
Was stored. My wicked bees had borne away
Their queen and left no trace.
That very day,
An idle drone who sauntered through the air
I tracked and followed, and he led me where
My truant bees and stolen honey lay.
Twice faithless bees! They had sought out to eat
Rank, bitter herbs. The honey was not sweet.

Rivers And Allegory 

Spontaneous - intimate obscurity
Suddenly an enlightened certitude trifles
Deep inside, the mind spreads out the landscape
Wide meadows, a quick gush of green
The endless sky shedding blue
And in the soil of time are being sowed chronicles.
Is this the legendary loam, the seeds of the century
That may turn into a tree of elegance?
Incessant downpour in human memory?
Continual motion
River within me
And the allegory of it, without.

Salman Rushdie Is The Golden Boy Of Dream Allegory Fiction 

Those who do not know Salman Rushdie must know it
He is the golden boy
Of dream, allegory and the narrative technique,
Comics is his chief property
With which regales and jokes he,
Caricatures and comments
And criticizes,
An Indian, an Asiatic man
He tells about the adjusting and life-style
Of the immigrants and expatriates
Naturalized and domiciled in foreign,
How far Indian are those who live abroad,
The diaspora dais, dislocation and displacement,
The refugee problem, cultural ethnicity,
The quest for identity,
Settlement and re-settlement.

The Allegory Of An Unintentional Meeting 

the meeting was incisive
lie the way my tooth is relieved from pain
but he
thought about what i said before
that moment when
the glass was emptied of its black contents
that night inside a cube of ice
when what followed was the transparency
of air
when both sides can be seen at one glance
when goodbyes and hellos
look the same like Siamese twins
when one finally sees through a hole and for a while
glances like a window of rain where you cannot help but just stay as you do not like to dance
and then he
says that
the universe is there and it is
nothing at all

The Allegory Of The Cycle Of Doors 

and so there is this door that appears before you
and you open it
and then when you enter the room
another door appears
this is the cycle of doors that keep on appearing and you
keep on opening
but the room still appears from a distance
always distant
from your eager feet to enter
you say to enter the room i must please the door
but the room moves away just the same
and the door tells you
to keep the room
you have to burn it and when the room is burned
the door finally disappears
and then both the door and the room shall tell you
now be happy
for you now have a house of your own

The Allegory Of The Sea 

I write for epitaphs on headless graves.
The wind kisses my fingers affectionately.
She wishes that I would shave;
She is as junoesque as the burnished sea,
And as clichÃ©d: I said she should live in
The woods, by the pummel of a dead fallen
Tree, like a coffin still breathing,
And by night a busty epiphany, and opal
By which I stand erect and salute;
I mount by way of root, but waking up
She swims away, back to her bedroom
Far in the city, her eyes going wavering,
Wavering; awakened, she is the allegory
For the sea, doused in salt, yet living;
Her lips the well-meanings of what people
Mean to say; there nests an albatross, yet
To make house calls around our mast doused
In sun. I only wonder if I might stay my hand,
Or damn us all by kissing her.

The Ugly Dogs And Drunkard Guards (Allegory And Satire)
May 28, 2020
No sooner had the sacks of rice released from godown
Than the butcher chased dogs snatched,
Biting the sacks they began to run here and there
But they could not fully tear,
Soon the ugly dogs were kicked and beaten
And the most of the sacks were rescued
Through a long harassment and bearing others' pain
By the dull headed, drunkard guards.

Unknown And Unforeseen Allegory 

Likening to a thunder
came down a boulder
fell down with a noise
made things look like toys
men working ran away
apprehensive of the fall in a way
luckily none were too near
could save their life dear
the mishap caused a furore
the neighbours raised an uproar
nothing could have been done
as the prevention was all done
certain happenings could not be predicted
reasons could never be attributed
the case could be felt in life too
unknown and unforeseen take place true.

Anacreontic 

Mother of the tuneful Nine,
Nature prompt my ev'ry line;
I would not, had I Homer's fire,
To Mars and Slaughter strike the lyre;
A dearer theme my bosom fills,
My veins a softer rapture thrills;
Love, I know thy honied sting,
And the flutter of thy wing;
In my heart thou sitt'st supreme,
Making life a lover's dream,
Full of visions angel bright,
Till awakening in delight,
Tremulous I touch the strings;
'Tis not I-'tis Cupid sings.

Weep on; and, as thy sorrows flow,

Anacreontic Poem For Sweetheart 

Fill, fill your lips with honey,
You will be off on a journey;
The journey of life, filled with love,
And your soul mate is waiting,
To toast with your lips,
And fill his heart's desires,
Love, friendship, will develop soon
All the pleasures of life will boon.
Beat, beat your heart so fast,
To build enduring relations with a sweetheart;
Why leave the matter to destiny?
When you can make, own path.

Half burnt big animals in underground

When The Sun Goes Down Late In The Afternoon Anaphora Poem 

When late in the afternoon the sun hangs just above the trees and hillocks,
I think that you must experience the colours of the clouds yourself
I think that it would be pretty in a landscape painting,
I think that this dusk brings a silence, that itâ€™s lonely without you,
I think that you are late, are maybe still working, or have got some other plans
I think that the gathering clouds will catch you with rain,
I think that the doves tomorrow evening will also be in love and coo like this,
I think that the jasmine and lavender tomorrow evening will also fill the air.
I think I will dream of branches that hit from the wind on the roof,
I think that maybe tomorrow I will see you for the last time.

Abide After Philip Larkins Aubade 

Abide
by Michael R. Burch
after Philip Larkin's "Aubade"
It is hard to understand or accept mortalityâ€”
such an alien concept: not to be.
Perhaps unsettling enough to spawn religion,
or to scare mutant fish out of a primordial sea
boiling like goopy green tea in a kettle.
Perhaps a man should exhibit more mettle
than to admit such fear, denying Nirvana exists
simply because we are stuck here in such a fine fettle.
And so we abide...
even in life, staring out across that dark brink.
And if the thought of death makes your questioning heart sink,
it is best not to drink
(or, drinking, certainly not to think) .

An Aubade For Divine 

You're an awe-inspiring creature
Yea, you Divine whom I adore
The one that I am wishing for
To be my Truelove evermore.
But there are questions in my mind:
'How could we be my dear Divine,
And can you be my valentine? '
Then if you'll say 'no', all is fine.
Aye,
If you Divine would let me live,
With you for hundred thousand years;
There's none a thing I'll never give,

An Evergreens Aubade 

The Holm tree pinned me down,
Its twigs and leaves like tears
Streaking my face
And the pain, like the whole world
On top of me, only a Holm tree.
And I listened overseas to the pulp
Plantations, the dying cry of conifers.
I felt too late that sickly despair,
A vibrant sense of vengeance in the air.

Another Day An Aubade 

So beautifully you sleep in my dreams today,
But like everyday, the dawn will take you away,
And leave me all alone for yet another day.
So, won't you put the flowers from the bouquet,
Once more, just like the olden days, in your hair,
And let them adorn you, before you go away?
I will live, waiting for another night, another day,
But these flowers will die if you don't stay,
Leave me, but take the flowers with you,
Unlike me, they cannot live without you.

April Aubade 

Worship this world of watercolor mood
in glass pagodas hung with veils of green
where diamonds jangle hymns within the blood
and sap ascends the steeple of the vein.
A saintly sparrow jargons madrigals
to waken dreamers in the milky dawn,
while tulips bow like a college of cardinals
before that papal paragon, the sun.
Christened in a spindrift of snowdrop stars,
where on pink-fluted feet the pigeons pass
and jonquils sprout like solomon's metaphors,
my love and I go garlanded with grass.
Again we are deluded and infer
that somehow we are younger than we were.

Day and night
our hearts beat,

breath swells our ardent lungs

Oh, hear how the morning dove moans
in the pale early light;
wander with me
with open arms,
embrace the radiant eye.
Our love grows
as slowly
we rise.

Aubade Free Verse Sonnet 

At the window a yellow weaver twitters
while in the early morning I long for you,
it sounds to me like a senseless rant
but I notice one hanging upside-down at a nest
and at your window I also want to sing a song of praise,
early when the morning-red appears the first time,
with the dew bring my sincere love to you
and amaze you with depth and beauty.
I see the morning star and moon hanging low,
when dumbfounded I think about you as a woman,
both are so bright and pretty blue-white
while my prayers and thoughts do go to you
and when the morning does swallow the wind,
I do want to embrace you tightly.

Aubade Homesong 

Big sun already, fourth of July; waves
of heat creasing vision; scent
of magnolia strong-arms the yard;
exhausted zinnias buckle under.
Huge morning wanders my way,
familiar, supple; I know its swathe
and waste, its storm-cowl
hung on the horizon.
Some memories you wear like a locket.
It's heartless, though,
this imageless gravity of home,
this savage lodestone.

All pleasantries to all pair coiled.

All nature take leisure turn after turn - -

Afraid of all his acts.- - -

I know my leaving in the breakfast table mess.
Bowl spills into bowl: milk and bran, bread crust
crumbled. You push me back into bed.
More "honey" and "baby."
Breath you tell my ear circles inside me,
curls a damp wind and runs the circuit
of my limbs. I interrogate the air,
smell Murphy's Oil Soap, dog kibble.
No rose. No patchouli swelter. And your mouthâ€”
sesame, olive. The nudge of your tongue
behind my top teeth.
To entirely finish is water entering water.
Which is the cup I take away?
More turning me. Less your arms reaching
around my back. You ask my ear
where I have been and my body answers,
all over kingdom come.

Shrouded mist engulfs the morn

Whispering breeze of senses rife
Unfolding morn, awakens life

At dawn this song of love is sung,
A sweet Serenade carressing, a beauties eardrum,
Lost within the sweeness of this melody,
we slowly slip in and out of reality,
More than mere clothes shall come undone,
Words are left to be pondered, and replayed,
A repition of my Crimson heart beat.
At dawn this Song of love is sung,
A sweet serenade, carressing a beauties eardrum,
A faint tinge of blood rushes to her cheeks,
Love dost touch the faint color from the heart,
Marks upon the mind are made,
from the gentle notes of this serenade.

Aubade 

As golden flowers; pure and bright
give birth to the sun with gilded light;
and flowing springs in turmoil sway
blossom into the heat of gentle day;
then through the trees, as bluebirds sing
the purpled leaves in breeze they fling.
Rise, rise; yellow waves, arise!
Through cloud and sky, their cupped hands thinned;
yellow waves, arise!
And on the leaves with pearl-dropp gleams
lay tears of the rain like sweet-laid dreams;
as onto morning, from dew stained pond
croak frogs of the green in notes that bond;
then on the trees, as bluebirds shiver
and wind blows loud, the branches quiver.
Rise, rise; yellow waves, arise!
Through cloud and sky, their cupped hands thinned;
yellow waves, arise!

Aubade 

There's loneliness and there's thisâ€”
an unfrequented song, a startling voice
across years. A shifting position, hymn
from the hard bench, sharp something in
there, glass-glinted. If the movement
of trees in the weather front were enough.
If the notes were off-pitch but piercing
(which they are) as birdcall across
the stirring hour. In the woods,
a rustling of creatures we have no
idea of. Outcrops of limestone, wet leaves
lush and deadly. There's a time for killing,
some tell us, in the corner
of the who-knows-whereabouts. Everywhere,
the roadside lilies in thick morning
dew open orange and in numbers, one
after the other. Sun so strange it's as
though our looking, for a time, is first.

Wrapped futilely
in the realm of beauty sleep â€“
dawn rarely dawns on me.
Long after the appointed hour,
the room is thunder-black -
draw back the curtains.
The sky has lost
its breathing space â€“
choked by the clouds,
voluptuously hanging
in their mourning drapes â€“
symbolic of a troubled world.
I sigh, and seek
the duvetâ€™s solace â€“
for me the day
has not yet quite begun.

The gentle rain these sad gardens drink
To the harbour beyond goes home again,
As street lamps and orange foglights prink
The gentle rain.
The vast bridge alone no night could stain,
But grey did subsume the sunset's pink,
And it shrouds even now the dawning's gain.
Across the harbour the city lights wink,
The link of gold in a priceless chain,
As leadened here we watch on silver's brink
The gentle rain.

There is nothing waiting at end of night,
Merely the onset of regular day,
Practiced routines pawned off in the light.
Dreams suddenly unknown slip out of sight,
Hurrying from the stage as if in a play,
There is nothing waiting at end of night.
Now the morning folds over pale and bright,
Bringing once more a familiar way,
Practiced routines pawned off in the light.
Outside the sky like a migraine glares white,
Discharged from sleep and impressed here to stay.
There is nothing waiting at end of night.
Get up, get up, for the time is now right
To start anew your ritual dismay,
Practiced routines pawned off in the light.
Awakened you fall as from a great height
And the black nocturnal vault fades to gray,
There is nothing waiting at end of night,
Practiced routines pawned off in the light.

That sycamore leaf! I knew it fell
Upon my heart as well
As on the head of my dear May,
And I have brooded all the night
In fear I would be left alone
With all my thoughts as cold as stone,
Fancying what words to say.
But with the blessed gift of light
The faint delusions passed away,
I raised the casement to the thrill
Of morn, a bird upon the sill
Alit and sang a song so gay,
Its echo follows, follows still:
So all night's phantoms fly with day.

Always bringing evermore the ocean

Bringing sweet thoughts and views unfurled just now
Bring a smile to my face as they unwind
Of our life together and yet somehow

Never seen again outward I now flow

A Ballad Of The Mulberry Road 

The sun rises in south east corner of things
To look on the tall house of the Shin
For they have a daughter named Rafu,
(pretty girl)
She made the name for herself: 'Gauze Veil,'
For she feeds mulberries to silkworms.
She gets them by the south wall of the town.
With green strings she makes the warp of her basket,
She makes the shoulder-straps of her basket
from the boughs of Katsura,
And she piles her hair up on the left side of her headpiece.
Her earrings are made of pearl,
Her underskirt is of green pattern-silk,
Her overskirt is the same silk dyed in purple,
And when men going by look on Rafu
They set down their burdens,
They stand and twirl their moustaches.

Into the woods my Master went,
Clean forspent, forspent.

Forspent with love and shame.
But the olives they were not blind to Him,
The little gray leaves were kind to Him:
The thorn-tree had a mind to Him
When into the woods He came.
Out of the woods my Master went,
And He was well content.
Out of the woods my Master came,
Content with death and shame.
When Death and Shame would woo Him last,
From under the trees they drew Him last:
'Twas on a tree they slew Him -  last
When out of the woods He came.

A Ballad Of The Two Knights 

Two knights rode forth at early dawn
A-seeking maids to wed,
Said one, "My lady must be fair,
With gold hair on her head."
Then spake the other knight-at-arms:
"I care not for her face,
But she I love must be a dove
For purity and grace."
And each knight blew upon his horn
And went his separate way,
And each knight found a lady-love
Before the fall of day.
But she was brown who should have had
The shining yellow hair --
I ween the knights forgot their words
Or else they ceased to care.
For he who wanted purity
Brought home a wanton wild,
And when each saw the other knight
I ween that each knight smiled.

Those who sailed at dawn
but will never return
left their trace on a wave--
a shell fell to the bottom of the sea
beautiful as lips turned to stone
those who walked on a sandy road
but could not reach the shuttered windows
though they already saw the roofs--
they have found shelter in a bell of air
but those who leave behind only
a room grown cold a few books
an empty inkwell white paper--
in truth they have not completely died
their whisper travels through thickets of wallpaper
their level head still lives in the ceiling
their paradise was made of air
of water lime and earth an angel of wind
will pulverize the body in its hand
they will be
carried over the meadows of this world

Flutters above your head,
Many a crest that is famous in story.
Mount and make ready then,
Sons of the mountain glen,
Fight for the Queen and our old Scottish glory.
Come from the hills where your hirsels are grazing,
Come from the glen of the buck and the roe;
Come to the crag where the beacon is blazing,
Come with the buckler, the lance, and the bow.
Trumpets are sounding,

Stand to your arms, then, and march in good order;

When the Blue Bonnets came over the Border.

of what is referred to by the locals as the Deira district,
 right in the midst of it all, I guess it would be like the
 street over from Times Square, or maybe the main shopping 
strip in Brooklyn, where after sitting and having a cup of 
coffee, you can go straight out and feel the rush of the wo
rld outside of the door going about a hundred miles an hour
.  There was a young lady whom I shall call Anna, like a lo
t of the others, I've incorporated her into one of the book
s that I'm writing, and even when we don't talk, she always
 has a story to tell, for she'll sit a few tables away from
 me and still capture my attention, going from happy to sad
, to being passionately in love to even being dissatisfied;
 a platonic Scheherazade.  I can't be exactly sure what she
 told her friends of me; a dichotomous story of extremes af
ter we met; but the next time her friends stopped by to tal

 I moved here, I don't go by very much, so whenever I have 
the chance, I call and invite myself over for a hot cup of coffee or just a short and cordial conversation.
Usually I call home with nothing in particular to say; how i
s everything going, who's all there, what's for dinner, or 
did I get any mail; five minutes or so and say good-bye.  O
ne day it was okra, sometimes pork chops, fried chicken, so
metimes gumbo; and she usually offers; but an hour walk ove
r to her house or just as long transferring on buses, makes the acceptance rare.
My relationship with my mother has taken a progressive and e
ven pragmatic course; I'm sure I was the most loved child w
hen younger, of the five of us, but I'm sure we all thought
 that.  Though as I have become older, I can see the relati
onship that she has with the rest of the family, I think it
's all shared equally.  Yet over the last several years, I 
think that I probably found myself saying the least, though
 seeing the bond between Barbara and her grow more than eve
r before.  Barbara is the oldest, and their relationship ha
s taken the opposite course; saying more over the years as 
we have grown older, or rather more mature; thus their rela
tionship has grown tremendously.  And even being more surpr
ised as how close the bond between Gary, my younger brother
, the youngest child in the family, has also grown, and the
 bonds between Clinton Jr., my oldest brother and Brenda, m
y youngest sister; I guess noticing the way that we have ch
anged over the years, though something that I wouldnâ€˜t ha
ve noticed when I was younger, but have truly appreciated b
eing able to see it form and mature over the last several y
ears.  So that makes two brothers and two sisters, a mom an
d a dad; I think two and half is supposed to be the size of
 a normal family, but apparently my mom and dad tried to improve on that; my friend that I grew up with, his mom had sixteen kids.
My dad and Mom are about the same age; though I think that m
y dad may be a year younger; they are both from Louisiana; 
my mom from Saint Martinsville, and my dad from Shatan or I think he said the name changed later to Ville Platt.
When I called she said that he had gone to work for the day;
 to one of the day labors; I think last week she said that 
he may start driving a truck again; â€˜Here comes that levi
athan', Here comes the battle of the tireless with eighteen
 wheels; he has been driving for as long as I can remember,
 and even had the chance as a kid to go out with him a coup
le of times when he worked for Steadman, a paper recycling 
company where we would pick up bails of paper and take them
 to the warehouse.  But all of the above reasons make calling home of course almost a natural response.
But as I said, the phone call seems to take on a pattern of 
a cordial family phone call that I have been familiar with 
all of my life, and one that causes even a subconscious awa
reness of those we love without putting it together until s
omething extraordinary, either good or bad, causes it to make a profound plea for manifestation.
Ironically enough, it's my mom's birthday, so we'll go over 
to wish her what you would call a happy birthday, though ab
out my mom's and dad's age, they usually admonish you for h
aving brought too many candles.  I called her yesterday jus
t to say hello, and talked for a while, and told her that I would go by on her birthday.
I saw Clinton Jr. and his wife Sibil last Sunday; Easter Sun
day, and told them the same.  They came to pick me up and g
ave me a ride over to my mom's house for Easter supper in o
ne of the smaller leviathans with four wheels and five door
s called a blue van, which between the plate that I had ove
r there and the one she gave me to take with me, has kept m
e filled even until today.  When I called yesterday she sai
d that she and my dad were sitting outside; that was about 
six o'clock; sometimes they grab a couple of  chairs, a cup
 of coffee and sit outside just as it begins to cool off a 
little before the setting of the sun.  She told me that her
 granddaughter, my niece, was glad for the Barbie doll that
 I bought her, and I will have to pick up something for her older brother also.
Barbara, since she works the afternoons was probably there w
ith her son or rather, my mom told me that they had gone to
 the store, every now and then, they jump into the car just
 to go out for a little drive before coming in for the even
ing.  Brenda may have been still at work; she usually stops
 by on her way home. I asked her how was school going, she 
said that she was taking six hours and would probably take 
nine or twelve next semester.  I told her that I just called to say hello after getting in from work.
I asked my Mom did she want me to pick her up something; she
 said a chicken, and some cooking oil; my mom cooks rather 
well; there is just about nothing that I wouldn't eat that 
she cooks, except cabbage, mustard greens or okra; where I 
lost the taste for it, I have no idea; but I look forward t
o seeing the grandkids learning how to cook or bake somethi
ng themselves.  I don't know how they see handing down the 
art of cooking; either as a secret or cultural heritage; I'
ve tried to get her to teach me a couple of times but never
 really caught on; though my mom's brother; Chris, is a gre
at cook; something that he probably got from his mom; my gr
andmother.  So our first venture will be a trip over to grandma's house.
Love, Otradom

1 Grand Mathilda And Her Cohorts America From The Motivation To Invest The Motivation To Win Prose Bio 

'My Mom and Dad (Hilda Mae and Clinton Thomas Sr.)     are e
xtra motivators when taking on arduous ventures, (and it go
es for their cohorts, those their age in general, as much) 
.  Being born in the post-Great Depression era, in the 30's
, in Louisiana, like for the rest of America, was trying en
ough, coupled with being black parents in the segregated so
uth in the 40's 50's and 60's, made life at that time even 
more challenging.  At the age of five, my mother being one 
of the oldest of ten children along with my grandparents wh
o packed everything into boxes and put them on back of the 
truck, headed to Texas from St Martinsville, Louisiana. My 
dad from Shatan or I think he said the name changed later to Ville Platt.
My Mom and Dad worked hard, taught us how to pray each day, 
respect and love one another, supported and encouraged me a
nd my siblings, they also taught us to enjoy working (which
 each one of us had worked somewhere before graduating from
 high school.) , would be the second motivator. Although I 
started working at the age of eleven or twelve, there was v
ery little at the end of the week to save, and little reason to save with the amount I would get working part-time.
By the time I was twelve, I had worked before, like most eag
er children at that age had wished to do but couldn't. My D
ad, besides being a truck driver was somewhat of a handy-ma
n, and thus I can remember doing odd jobs with him, from wo
rking with people renovating their homes, to helping unload
 bails of paper for the Standard Paper Co. that he worked for as a truck driver.
I threw Grit (America's Greatest Family Newspaper Inc.)     
with Clinton Jr., my older brother, a bundle of weekly news
papers, which they would mail to him, sort of a thrift maga
zine, that he would get paid for by walking door to door an
d selling a single copy to whoever would listen long enough
 and buy one each week. On Saturdays, my Mom would give me 
permission along with a small loan for gas, to walk down to
 the house at the end of the block and rent a lawnmower fro
m Albert, the neighborhood mechanic who of course repaired 
lawnmowers in his garage and rented them out, to cut the ne
ighbor's yards for extra money. Then of course, I delivered
 the local city paper, like a lot of young boys at that age, The Beaumont Enterprise and Journal.
One day after getting home from school, my oldest sister, Ba
rbara, called me and told me that they needed someone to wo
rk where she was working at; I was in the seventh grade, so
 she must have been in the twelfth grade, since she is five
 years older than me and started school a year earlier. The
 local university, Lamar University, was about two miles aw
ay from where I went to school, and thus it would make the 
perfect after school part-time job. So I would walk about a
 mile to school in the morning, then after school two miles
 to work, and though my Dad would pick me up most of the ti
mes from work, sometimes I would walk the three or so miles
 home in the evening (A mile to school, two miles to work and three miles back home) .
I had an early growth spurt, and then, those who were taller
 were usually asked to do more, from school, to sports, and
 to work; so at 3: 00 pm, off to work I would go. My sister
 and aunt worked there during the day in the kitchen as coo
ks and my Mom worked there at night as a custodian, and the
n as a chef the next morning on her second job, downtown at one of the best cafes in the city, called Whitby's.
And that growth spurt also allowed me to get one of the easi
ly minted social-security cards, and an I. D. with whatever
 age I or anyone else would tell the clerk; so from eleven 
or twelve one day to sixteen or seventeen the next (just to
 start working at an early age) , which was the age one had
 to be to work in 1978. Being one of the few kids who worke
d and thus had my own money, was an experience that would last a life time.
I worked there for a year, at the university, one of the top
 ten engineering schools in the country, then took over for
 my older brother as a sacker at the local grocer named Gia
nt Foods owned by a good friend of his named Richard; the F
erguson's owned a couple stores in the area, and later move
d to a cashier's position after my brother joined the army;
 of course, I still needed the fake social security card and I. D.
I was born in 1964, Martin Luther King Jr. was still alive, 
but of course I was too young to have understood the intens
ity of the atmosphere of the civil rights movement, and the
 reasons which it was being propelled.  And thus, even toda
y, although there is still inequality, though not compared 
to then, and being a black family struggling in the south t
o make, it becomes difficulty to try and give and empatheti
c account of what one was going through at that time. After
 twenty, thirty and forty years working, and like my Mom, t
wo jobs, raising a family, being good employees, friends an
d citizens, helping build the company that they worked for,
 along with the city and country where they lived, for what
 was, for a lot of people, average if not below average wag
es, especially for minorities and women.  And thus end up w
ith a fraction of what they could have had based on how muc
h more we now put into finance (and personal finance) , investing (and personal investing)     and employee benefits.
Also, at that time in American history, there were not too m
any ways that either they (my parents)     or the company t
hat they worked for, to invest what was left over after all
 of the above, plus paying the bills. Although it's not the
 30's,40's,50's or even the 60's, the new millennium has a 
lot of the same problems, some which should have gotten bet
ter that hasn't, like the wage disparity/difference, not ha
ving kept up as it should have, and the word inequality rep
lacing segregation and racism whether it be in the south, n
orth, east or west. But like then, whether it is trying to 
deal with the post-Great Depression Era, propelling the imp
etus of a Civil Rights Movement or creating a personal inve
sting program which aids in changing the high fail-rate to 
a higher success-rate, we have to, and have the ability to work on those problems

1 Lelas Song Turkey From Songs From The Women Of The L O M Prose Bio 

Lela's Song
(I got the idea of the â€˜Song' while talking to Lela, you'l
l see as I explain in the following paragraphs, while talki
ng to her one evening and feeling comfortable enough, like 
she simultaneously did, tried to explain and show her some 
of the things that I do.  I played some of the recordings  
that I had made some time ago of some of the poetry that I 
had written to hear how it sounded, for editing purposes, w
hich she only considered interesting. I  then sat her down,
 and after a little while of talking to her, I decided that
 I wanted to keep her story, â€˜song', and picked up the co
mputer and began to write it as she sat there watching me c
ompose as much as I could remember her telling me, up until
 that very moment. At the end of about half a page, I scrol
led back up to the top and titled it â€˜Lela's Song'. I cou
ld, though I was myself truly surprised, see that she authe
ntically enjoyed an uncontrollable moment of pleasure, as s
he sat up and turned her head to the side for only a short 
moment, the virtuous embarrassment of having someone do something nice for her, before returning back with the mask.)
Lela, Nanya's friend, had seen me come in one late afternoon
 and walked up to me and went through the motions of prepar
ing to sit down for a long and intriguing conversation, and
 watched me pass up something that she knew I wanted, ironi
cally the polished product which she was pretending to pres
ent to me, when she knew that I was totally preoccupied wit
h a few things on my mind, but something that I had been as
king for, subliminally and subconsciously; not only and int
imate relationship, here, intimate meaning to have an in-de
pth conversation, talking beyond the superficial salutation
s, and being extended where we would, I guess you would say
, although it was fate that had brought us together, become
 friends, but I guess it manifested itself more than even I
 thought. Only when I had decided that it wasn't there any 
longer did it appear, and she felt safe enough to play with it, while I sat and had a cup of coffee with way too much on my mind.
Lela is a young and vibrantly beautiful lady; twenty-one yea
rs old whom I met in the beautiful city of Dubai. Today, un
like the first time that we met, her hair is streaked with 
light brown rather than jet black, like the first time that
 it was when I met her, the streaks of brown, being a fashi
onable trend, but something that I couldnâ€˜t help notice, 
but didnâ€˜t note, or dare mention, that how lovely she loo
ked with straight ebony black hair sitting just below her s
houlders.  And I couldn't help notice as we sat there, how 
I could see so many faces, not here in the Middle East, but
 back home, seeing her being mother to many American women 
I have met in the past and also now; and through her, having a chance to sit and talk with them.
Having been there for four years, leaving a son and mother i
n Turkey; Istanbul, for like many people, whether Dubai, Ne
w York or LA, to find not a better life, but more financial
 opportunity until one manifest's itself at home.  Ironical
ly, her son is only four years old, dramatically enough, le
aving him at the age of only six months old, going home whe
never the opportunity presents itself to see him, and of co
urse her Mom who keeps him fed, clothed and loved until she
 returns to assure him that all, if not yet is well, will soon be.
The days, something I tried to find out, even wanted to know
 about, hasn't been all perfect for Lela, some days have be
en, God forbid, perpetually a struggle, for I have seen, al
though with hope, it would only be transitory, those days w
hile traveling through the US from one city to another; try
ing to find work, a place to stay, etc., but she, with a re
alistic understanding of her situation, has faith that she 
will make it.  For as I sat there with my mind racing to ke
ep up with her attempt at discretely trying to explain, tha
t life for some of the young ladies there in the Deira dist
rict, as with many other places, can be a plight.  The adju
stments of understanding this had to be made instantaneousl
y and transformed back into a cordial conversation of still
 discrete empathy, where my thoughts would not be an interr
uption to our litany, and thus we sat there in a dimly lit 
room as she continued describing her affair with what life 
sometimes, as I said, in a providential manner; (providenti
al) , it being a prelude to another life unfolding without 
true awareness of it, that will still discretely enough deliver many more positive outcomes to a beautiful young lady named Lela.
Of course I struggled still with my advice of trying an orth
odox approach of asking about finding work, but I knew that
 it would be a clichÃ© heard many times, followed by a well
 prepared answer, for I know after meeting many people whil
e traveling through the US, that there can be many reasons 
as to why or why not; something, because of all the many di
fferent reason, I gave the title, 'A Most Complex Situation
', even more so in the Middle East, especially for women.  
There are many similarities that she apparently spoke of, w
hile even prudently trying to explain her situation, which 
I have seen throughout America while traveling from coast t
o coast.  Getting enough money to come to Dubai, it is only
 the beginning of what could possibly be a long road, and a
fter getting there, is when it starts.  For she spoke of th
e issue of rent, trying to earn the money to pay for the ap
artment on a day to day basis, and having enough left over 
for even life's basic necessities, which when just starting
 out, can be very costly until she's able to save up the mo
ney for the daily rent.  Because of course, she is just sta
rting out, she want have the money for the rent, or deposit
; the things she needs on a daily basis: food, clothing, pe
rsonal items, and if God doesn't forbid, a personal life wh
ere there is a little happiness other than knowing that one day it will turn out right.
I have thought about this, and it can change from relocating
 to a different country to try and find a better opportunit
y, which is almost unheard of in America; least migrating t
o and not from; thus a very bold move to begin with; to hom
elessness, by it's varied definitions - until one has a per
manent place of their own, to what it can change into, thou
gh at the moment I'm speaking of the more austere aspects, 
like becoming complacent or oppressed by an ever present st
ruggle to try and, as they say, â€˜get ahead'.  And though 
I have seen it manifest itself in many places back home, I 
couldn't help but have it resurface here while thinking abo
ut the people in Iraq about a year and a half ago, when I f
irst started my job overseas.  And once more, the reasons a
re quite diverse as to why people could be going through, a
lthough worlds away, similar plights to trying to attain a 
better life.  Ironically I was reading an article on the in
ternet; looking up Chechnya, trying to find out more about 
the world of Nanya, and it stated that the unemployment rat
e was about seventy-six percent; I think eight percent woul
d be considered a major recession in the US, and certainly 
because of the recent happenings in Iraq, making these two 
places almost identical, as far as the problems that many o
f the people would be having trying to attain this better l
ifestyle.  Yet I thought it was an overlooked understatemen
t that I had read in  Government and the Economy by Lane an
d Ersson, that said that income or GDP of a country and its
 people, doesn't justify true quality or happiness of life.
  And thought about both above statements, overcoming auste
re circumstances and true quality of life, while meeting th
e people in Iraq for the first time, although from the insi
de of a cab of an eighteen-wheeler, yet only several feet a
way if not inches away on many occasions.  And seeing them 
farming, herding, selling merchandise on side of the road; 
I said that the day that there will be Wal Marts, K Marts a
nd Targets out here, the day the economy starts booming, th
ey will be a really competitive people, which we know that 
competition makes the pie bigger for everyone, and seeing p
eople, men, women and children living in landfills, along w
ith their livestock, (in the future, even now in America, t
hese are prudent investments) , yet I couldn't help but car
ry the weight of these two concepts, with the only resoluti
on for either, being that things will get better in the fut
ure.  Though not as someone looking for answers, but someon
e with sympathy, I find empathy a very trying word at times
, for it's truly hard to put yourself in someone else's sho
es when you know that they are going through a trying time.
 I often hope to one day meet them, in the landfills, herdi
ng or selling merchandise on side of the road, for I would 
attain the same pleasure as meeting them walking down the s
treets back in my hometown, or any town, USA. It's somethin
g that I couldn't explain or find the words for, and wouldn
't dare write until after having the conversation that Lela and I had the evening we were sitting down a thousand miles away in Dubai.
Though like everywhere else I have been, I can see things ch
anging, especially for women, and thought about the book th
at I recently finished reading on Princess Sultana Al Su'ad
's of Saudi Arabia, called  Princess Sultana's Circle.  It'
s a story authored by Jean Sasson, where together these two
 women help describe the oppression of women in the Middle 
East and plot out a resolution for helping them overcome it
.  Being a princess of the royal family who prudently is wo
rking for women's rights, where troubling enough, her two d
aughters take a dichotomous trek on the affair. One daughte
r siding along with her mother's quest for those rights, an
d the other clinging staunchly with the traditional orthodo
x Muslim customs.  It was a book where when searching throu
gh it for notes and certain passages, I found myself readin
g chapters over again, only to be touched equally as much, 
and could have seen a passage on the lovely young lady name
 Lela, seeking a better life with great youth, beauty and p
otential, yet with the elusive limited access of choices.  
So I tried surreptitiously, by asking her could I pay for h
er to take a trip somewhere just to get away for a while, t
o see where the oppression had settled, though I think it w
as the accepting so soon, which made her say no more than a
nything else.  We sat and talked several times afterwards b
efore I prepared and headed out on a short journey to Europ
e for the first time, other than Holland, ironically where 
the house that harbored a young lady called Ann Frank and h
er family from the Nazis before being captured and put in a
 concentration camp is located.  This is only a small passa
ge of the time we shared, the rest I shall work out later t
o find out just as much about life as about this young lady named Lela, and even myself.

1 Marys Song Iran From Songs From The Women Of The L O M Prose Bio 

Mary's Song
There are people that you meet, and most of the time, especi
ally when you don't think that they notice that you are wat
ching them, when they are not looking directly at you, and 
of course this is what happened; as I have seen her frequen
tly; having talked to her occasionally, and enjoyed seeing 
her; and I can only say this in retrospection, that she mak
es me smile inside; and as I continue I'll eventually, thou
gh prudently reveal why. One, a person whom you could enjoy
 looking at as much as talking to, which as I said, I had a
 chance to do both, and again, only being able to say this 
in retrospect, was after sitting down on the couch and havi
ng a meaningful dialogue with this young lady that will, as much she did myself, enlighten as well as entertain you.
Now she only wears high-heel shoes, forgive me if I'm not an
 expert on women's fashion, but they are sort of like the o
pen thongs; on the back, sensuously exposing the pink soft 
flesh of the feet, but where these are, I'm sure the latest
 in design, also adds several inches to her height; at leas
t two or three easily, but dramatically enough, you wouldn'
t truly notice it, because she has, forgive me if not inten
tional, an amusing strut; she does more than just walks, an
d she waves at me all of the time, so I know, she discretel
y sees me imbibing her persona, and allowing it to tantaliz
e, I guess I can say, many parts of the senses, and discret
ely manifesting and uncontrollable yet infatuated and returned glance.
When Mary told me that she was from Iran, I was even more fe
rvidly moved, for many reasons; it brought up a lot of issu
es; most of them in the news on a daily basis, from religio
us issues to nuclear proliferation, and I had recently read
 a really enlightening article on Iran and the issues it br
ought up as being a global player in today's world, and I r
ecently went back and read once more where the author commented on these events, saying...
'â€¦At one end of the spectrum are the hardest of the hard-l
iners, who disparage economic and diplomatic considerations
 and put Iran's security concerns ahead of all others.  At 
the opposite end are pragmatists, who believe that fixing I
ran's failing economy must trump all else if the clerical r
egime is to retain power over the long term.  In between th
ese camps waver many of Iran's most important power brokers
, who would prefer not to have to choose between bombs and butter'.
This split provides an opportunity for the United States, an
d it's allies in Europe and Asia, to forge a new strategy t
o derail Iran's drive for nuclear weapons.  The West should
 use its economic clout to strengthen the hand of Iranian p
ragmatists, who could then argue for slowing, limiting, or 
shelving Tehran's nuclear program in return for the trade, 
aid, and investment that Iran badly needs.  Only if the mul
lahs recognize that they have a stark choice -they can have
 nuclear weapons or a healthy economy, but not both-might t
hey give up their nuclear dreams.  With concern over Iran's
 nuclear aspirations growing, the United States and its allies now have a chance to present Iran with just such an ultimatum.
In an interview in 2002, the pragmatic minister of defense, 
Ali Shamkhani, warned that the 'existence of nuclear weapon
s will turn us into a threat to others that could be exploi
ted in a dangerous way to harm our relations with the count
ries of the region.  The economic dimension of nuclear dipl
omacy is also pushing the pragmatists of multilateral sanct
ions.  'If there [are] domestic and foreign conflicts, fore
ign capital will not flow into the country, ' Rafsanjani ha
s warned.  'In fact, such conflicts will lead to the flight
 of capital from this country.  On one course, Iran would a
gree to give up its nuclear program, accept a comprehensive
 inspection regime, and end its support for terrorism.  In 
exchange, the United States would lift sanctions and settle
 Iran's claims over the assets of Shah Mohammed Rezza Pahla
ve.  The West would also consider bringing Iran into intern
ational economic organizations such as the World Trade Orga
nization, granting Iran increased commercial ties, and perh
aps even providing it with economic assistance.  Western na
tions could sweeten the deal by agreeing or assisting Iran 
with its energy needs (the ostensible reason for its nuclea
r research programs)   and to forswear direct military atta
ck.  The United States could also help create a new securit
y architecture in the Persian Gulf in which Iranians, Arabs
, and Americans would find cooperative ways to address thei
r security concerns, much as Washington did with the Russia
ns in Europe during the 1970s and the 1980s.  If, on the ot
her hand, Iran decided to stay its current course, U.S. all
ies would join Washington in imposing precisely the sort of
 sanctions the mullahs fear would scuttle Iran's precarious
 economy.  These sanctions could take the form of everythin
g from barring investment in specific projects or entire se
ctors (such as the oil industry)   to severing all commerci
al contacts with Iran if it proved utterly unwilling to add
ress Western demandsâ€¦Spelling out in advance all of the s
teps Tehran is expected to take or to avoid, as well as the
 specific rewards and punishments they would incur, is the 
best way to prevent Iran and U.S. allies from reneging on t
heir commitments as they have in the pastâ€¦Because Iran's 
economic woes have been a major factor in popular disconten
t with the regime, there is good reason to believe that, if
 forced to make such a choice, Tehran would grudgingly opt 
to save its economy and look for other ways to deal with its security and foreign policy aspirations.
But I'm also enlightened from a cultural perspective; a soci
ological one, humanitarian, and add all of the above togeth
er, it only means that I love meeting people from different
 countries, cultures, places, and I could spend the rest of
 my days traveling just to do this, and thus we were in an 
intimate position, where I was in arms reach of her, and th
e conversation we are now having, allowed me to express a w
arm gesture of pleasure of hearing it by putting my hands o
n both sides of her temples and giving her a small but pass
ionate kiss, as if even something inside of me suddenly, and passionately moved also.
Maybe it was its (Iran's)   culture that I had heard about f
rom the days in grade school, ancient and current, certainl
y it was because she was a beautiful young woman; twenty-fi
ve; only to complement myself; she could have been even muc
h younger, and thus again, by all of the above reasons, add
ing to the unexpected surprise that was warmly met by her, 
excepted, and returned with a soft kiss of her own.  And al
l of the above, by now, for you, along with being fashionab
ly dressed, and with beautifully styled and kempt hair, I h
ave created a masterpiece, not of the Mona Lisa, but of a beautiful and lovely young lady; Mary.
All of this, of course has to be followed by, for the appeti
zer, was her strut, it invited me in, and thus, main course
 allowed me to hold her in my arms; followed by dessert, wh
ich came in seeing her take off, along with light outer gar
ment, the caricature of an even more soft and lovely person
, as she sat back to relax on the couch and allow me to att
empt to entertain her for the evening.  For above light gar
ment, there lay the faÃ§ade of a very, though cordial, and 
yet complimented with a smile, tough-girl persona, or shoul
d I say dilemma; for until, after habiliments lay on the co
uch,  there was the woman that possessed Mary, and I could 
not help but wonder how could such a delicate creature be t
he one in control.  So you can see me sitting there seeing 
her walk from one end of the room to the other on a few occ
asions, and each time I refused to pass up the opportunity 
to reconfirm what I was witnessing; hair that flowed down t
o sensuously curved shoulders, where it was just long enoug
h to give way to an even more delicate back that touched pe
rfectly round hips, and by the time that I did go from the 
back of her thighs to her feet, as she stood there; the abs
ence of the stylishly fashionable shoes, and along with it,
 also the absence of the two to three inches that were also
 bought at that time, which I still cannot wonder why, for 
its absence did make the perfect woman, while I sat on the 
couch staring, yet hoping that I could consume as much as p
ossible before having her turn around and wonder had I yet satisfied myself without her permission.
Moments later, as we set back on the couch continuing a conv
ersation that would allow us to talk about many different a
spects of life, yet, it did rang from an intimate strata; w
ork to raising a family, frequenting home, Iran and back to
 Dubai; children and family, and like the virtuoso, that pe
rsona only relaxed at the tune of the nights cadence.  She 
had a ring that she kept playing with on her finger, more t
han just subconscious playing with, and thus after immediat
ely noticing it, like her strut, catching me between pleasu
re and interest, I, not to think to quietly or too loudly, 
slowly had taken it out of her hand, held it between finger
tips for a few seconds, and told her that this would be our
 occupation for the rest of our lives, when she quietly ask
ed did I think it was possible; the questions having many a
venues, yet it had me now trying to remember the words, as 
I found myself saying, with this ring I do wed to be my wif
e for the rest of my life, which she mutually allowed and c
ondoned before sitting down and continuing our conversation into a nice Dubai summerâ€˜s night.

1 Nanyas Song Chechnya From Songs From The Women Of The L O M Prose Bio 

They were equally as beautiful and lovely, I remember asking
 one of them to marry me, you'll soon see that I will have 
asked just about each one of them to marry me, only to see 
them smile and discretely say no; every now and then, findi
ng one bold enough to say 'sure', when they know that my mi
nd is too far away to truly comprehend the acceptance at th
e moment, or they will ask â€˜why', then have it merge into
 the next question.  And her friend, Nanya, asked the rheto
rical; 'Do you want to get married', as she saw my mind dri
fting away from the same question that I had posed to her e
arlier, with me only vaguely hearing it and truly hearing i
t rhetorically, for a number of reasons; the main one, is t
hat she had me over infatuated with her personality; and ir
onically enough, not only by her beauty, for Nanya is a ver
y beautiful young lady, and not only by her youth, for she'
s young and contains the spiritual prowess of the spider; b
e it brown recluse or black widow, being pernicious, but ye
t soft, eloquent and delicate; making the mind defend befor
e giving in to her.  For the affair with her friend had see
m to be causing unforeseen problems, one that had me confus
ed, but because I had felt that feeling so frequently that 
she was displaying,  I thought I was looking at a mirror im
age of myself, and though it reflected what I often feel; r
egrettably the dilemma of the dichotomous thin line of love
 and turmoil, brought on by being touched by someone; but t
he longevity of it staring back at me for what I might have
 done, broke the trance of that reflection and caused me to
 now ponder on my recent behavior, and though I could find 
none inordinate, it still perpetuated itself, where I was a
lmost paralyzed from surprise that I could have transferred
 the monster that I elude on a daily basis to a young lady that I had now began to truly care about.
Nanya lives in Dubai's Deira district, where this is now tak
ing place; a city in the UAE (United Arabic Emirates) , onc
e ruled by His Highness Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum 
and now run by his heir, his son; His Highness Sheikh Hamda
n bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who has  just over a few decades, 
turned Dubai into one of the world's leading economic ports
 where a financial and business district snakes along the c
ity's waterway called the Creek, that many refer to as the 
Manhattan Skyline, which also brings in the bulk of the cit
y's imports.  And the small lobby of the Ambassador is now 
becoming full; an eloquent and comfortable hotel, where you
 will see many people from many walks of life visit, from y
our average business guru, to a family vacationing in Dubai
, where mom is dressed in the traditional black abbaya, alo
ng with the shayla covering her head; the gishwa; a thin bl
ack veil covering her face, rather than the burqa, which is
 made of a stiffer material, though I have, since I've been
 there, and I guess it's becoming part of a trendier fashio
n, if I'm correct, seen them now made out of a shaded synth
etic plastic material.  Dad's head is covered with a gutra,
 which the men wear around their head, tied with an igal, t
he black woolen head-rope and wearing the kandoura, the ank
le length traditional male white skirt.  The little ones wi
ll be mirror images of their parents, of course, just small
er, enjoying the fun of having gotten out for a while, and 
thus the lobby and dining area of this strategically placed
 hotel, which serves locals and tourist alike, has now become domicile; home, if only for a little while.
Anna sits there and stares; once my mind perceived her sayin
g that I broke her heart; this is the woman that I asked to
 marry me, and who replied â€˜no', and whom I have not seen
 afterwards until this very day.  And now, what the social 
psychologists would sometimes call an echo-niche; a group o
f men an women living in the same area/neighborhood, with m
any common bonds and interest, is now staring back at me as
 one;  and her friend, Nanya, now being the leader of this 
constituency with each second that goes by, and which becom
es more foreign each time the smallest of the hands move cl
ockwise, and with it, all routes and exits being closed her
e and abroad; for I was in the process of calling home on an hourly basis for assistance.
Like the true protector of the flock, she, Nanya, first hono
rs those she is with, and with it, allowing darkness to rul
e that hour of my life before she comes over, sits on side 
of me and if only in a twinkle of an eye, being salvation o
n earth, the same one that was delivered two thousand years
 ago.  Or as Immanuel Kant would articulately state, that (
'Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed imm
aturity.  Immaturity is the inability to use one's understa
nding without guidance from another.  This immaturity is se
lf-imposed when its cause lies not in lack of understanding
, but in lack of resolve and courage to use it without guid
ance from another.  Have courage to use your own understand
ing! ' - that is the motto of enlightenment.)     On my spi
ritual quest that I have been on for only a little over a d
ecade, on any man's or woman's quest, it is the ultimate pr
esence of the quest; to go into a situation that is either 
on the verge or has turned tumultuous, and deliver a resolu
tion, where it is either resolved or the worst is kept at b
ay until it can be resolved, and more virtuously enough, wh
ere everyone, simultaneously is at calm. And thus I go back
 into that prayer and add, The Year of The Peacemaker.  She
 sat there and as if surprised after asking did I want to t
alk to her friend, as I said, somewhat shocked when I said 
yes, which meant that everyone, until she asked, had though
t that there was a mutual and pessimistic feeling floating 
around the room.  She then asked me could she come up to th
e room with me; I told her yes and we walked up together; I
 only tell further because she keeps being surprised at mys
elf being the opposite of what she had thought; the vulgar 
monster that had fallen in love with her friend, and somewh
ere between he and her, the Heaven's providentially allowed
 it to be misinterpreted, so when all has given up on this 
situation, which is now spiraling into oblivion, Excalibur is pulled from the rock by the true heiress.
And of course from that exhilarating initial meeting, we con
tinued being friends and have had nice quiet talks about li
fe; I was showing her a video of my family, and was glad to
 have her give me the opportunity to think about them for a
n extended period of  time, and in amusing retrospection, r
emembered telling her how much I loved them; even having a 
chance to have such a long conversation these days are rare
, and it takes time to get somewhat of a rhythm going for s
omething so intimate; stating that, after seeing pictures o
f each one of them, that this was my mother, the love of my
 life, until I find a wife; ironically enough when the conc
ierge knocked on the door, she told him we were going to ge
t married, prudently reflecting on what I had said; I then 
went on to say, as we were scrolling through pictures and v
ideos, that these are my two beautiful sisters; I called my
 oldest niece my girlfriend and my youngest niece, a lovely
 little girl, whose face has launched a thousand ships, the
 Helen of Troy, even saw her humorously react when a pictur
e of a young lady who also lives in Dubai named Niva popped
 up on screen, and I said that this is Bad Girl Niva.  She 
then showed me a picture of her little boy back in Chechnya
, about fourteen years old, a nice and studious looking you
ng man, whom I would have loved to have met, and a picture 
of the countryside where she grew up, along with family and
 friends.  I had already, by the time that I had met Nanya,
 incorporated Anna into the other book that I am working on
 as one of my lead characters, and not to dare compare the 
two, for they are two unique people, from different worlds.
  Yet after meeting Nanya, and thinking about her, and the 
time we spent together, I found in her most of the things t
hat I was looking for; for she totally caught me off guard,
 things not found in a woman, for the qualities pervade gen
der, or man, but in someone special that I had been searchi
ng for, especially since starting what I have called my que
st, for a long time.  So as not to forget, I ran back to th
e computer, searched through the files and opened up the un
finished work, took one of the lead characters that I truly
 enjoyed working on, and thus, changed her name to Nanya, w
here of course I will go and only add to its' character with the life of this special young lady called Nanya.

1 Ritas Song Armenia From Songs From The Women Of The L O M Prose Bio 

The Next Phase
Rita's Song
On one of my many, though I would like to say, rare attempts
 at trying to either leave or return as scheduled, and it j
ust so happens, Dubai has become the place for my ever pres
ent futile attempts at trying to board a plane on time.  Ev
en at this moment, I sit here, having supposed to have left
 a day earlier and at this very moment, still not exactly s
ure when I will be leaving.  I stand today in the same spot
 that I was standing on the day of my departure from here l
ast time; saying that I can't believe this is happening aga
in; it happens every time, and something that I had to note
 before continuing, (this amusing thought that broke my con
centration of exasperation when finally giving up and tryin
g to write to forget about it all until tomorrow)   about t
he story of a lady that I will only have a short time to wr
ite about before sending this on to the publisher for print
ing; but couldn't go on without telling you about a woman w
hom I met while on my trip from the Middle East, heading  t
o Europe, and fortunately enough to have been able to see h
er one more time on my way back  here (to the U.S.)   or should I say farther East, to Iraq before returning.
She walked in when I was ordering a cup of coffee before goi
ng out into the city to buy, amongst other things, guitar s
trings, for this new found passion of mine, (after having m
ade attempts at playing the guitar, piano, keyboard and the
 trumpet, which I think is still broken, least that's what 
I say rather than trying to give an example as to why it, t
he trumpet, only sits on the top shelf of the closet at my 
mother's place.) , though I should have been heading back s
everal days ago; I quietly repeat this to myself, hoping th
at, least next time, it will help.  Yet she, Rita, walked u
p just like myself and ordered coffee, glanced over for a b
rief second, which I only caught out of the corner of my ey
e, and continued to sip.  With only one or two other people
 in the room, I began staring at her, surreptitiously, but 
on a few occasions to find her discretely looking my way, a
nd with a subtle smile where I began to wonder had, althoug
h I noticed her when she walked into the place, ordered and
 took her first sip, had I mis-queued and noticed her seren
dipitously late; for I did, after moments of thinking about
 it, walk over, and at her acceptance, ordered more to drin
k and began a dialogue into a world of a beautiful woman from Armenia; who has me call her by the familial appellation, Rita.
Today the place is empty basically, one or two people leavin
g, a few passing in and out, but this is the beginning of s
ummer; and because Dubai is basically nice and warm year ro
und, it attracts many peoples from the continent of Europe 
to the Far East and from Africa to the Indian subcontinent,
 especially to its famous beaches and tourist attractions. 
 Though in the Middle East to talk about the weather is sti
ll traditionally a delicate situation; it can easily, on ma
ny days, reach over one hundred and twenty, even a hundred 
and thirty degrees; it gives a new meaning to saying, well 
I grew up in Texas, at least you don't have the humidity, b
ut I also have truly become accustomed to it, even more so 
being an avid jogger, where I'll, like a lot of others, put
 on a pair of shorts and go for an afternoon jog.  But  wri
ting, and truly growing up in Texas with a rather diverse c
limate ourselves, though on a nice hot summer, reaching onl
y about one hundred and fifteen, I automatically have it in
 just about every paper I write, basically being a sun wors
hiper, and had thus written about it several times of cours
e before being told, to speak of it with added prudence.  A
nd thus, the lights are prudently turned off in certain par
ts of the building; the needed light squeezing through the 
stenciled letters on the doors and windows, along with the 
aroma of giant skewed slabs of either chicken, beef or mutt
on walking in each time the door opens from the restaurant 
exactly adjacent, and it gives that invitingly dark and coo
l feeling that can only be appreciated on days like this.  
Any other time, the room would be filled with many people; 
men, equally as many as the beautiful women that frequent t
he place, adding the missing pleasure to the romantically shadowed coolness of the day.
A nice cool red and white shirt, red pants, fitting sensuous
ly stylish on her, it forced a meticulous and playful pan f
rom head to toe that was met with soft white shoes and a ro
bust walk of prowess; and that picture for many reasons, a 
few which I shall shortly explain, engrained on both the mi
nd and heart.  One, though I can't truly tell while sitting
 down; how tall she is.  I am six feet tall, though automat
ically knowing that I'm  taller; but until I walked over an
d introduced myself did I truly realize it.  And two; at le
ast, the second reason, is that being about five feet tall,
 a pleasant difference in height; the height, walk and pers
ona, being very familiar, and if it were not for the romant
ically foreign accent, auburn hair, and several thousand mi
les away, she could have been the incarnation of a past aff
air, facetiously speaking; marriage.  Though like anyone fi
nally moving again, it is welcomed, for it brings fresh ima
ges, not of the past, but the future, without remorse of se
eing something familiar of days being perpetually secured; 
and knowing that now they may be used as life pleases; once
 again bringing pleasure and fortunately enough, more than 
the ability to imbibe a lovely young woman from Armenia who
 now is willing, besides sharing the future with me, also a cup of tea and  a nice cordial conversation.
The atmosphere there in this small, though quite pleasant ca
fÃ©, is a very cordial and relaxed one;  I have since I fir
st stopped there on several trips to and from the states (U
S) , checked in, ordered a shisha, I think apple flavored t
obacco and a hot cup of Turkish coffee, and have made The A
mbassador my domicile away from home, least away from work,
 since working overseas requires that you live there, and t
hus you will get to know many of the residents that frequen
t this cafÃ© and live nearby.  I would sit for hours, watch
ing TV and sipping on something nice, I'm often invited to 
a game of pool, if not from the cook from India, one of the
 local residents of the Diera District, and if you have see
n, as they say, seen me play, you would understand that it'
s much more than just a game of pool but a token of welcome
 and the beginning of a friendship, though it will be more 
discretely shared than openly expressed; especially when th
e last shot of the game, which I'm winning up until that po
int, amusingly ends with either a Minnesota Fats or Willie Misconi super, duper trick shot, and a smile until next time from the host.
Rita will be noticed and missed as we escape the TV, convers
ations and patrons playing at the video games; there is a b
ond of camaraderie that also acts as a firewall against ins
ecurities of friendships long shared.  And thus, we are now
 sitting down on either side of a small coffee table, facin
g an opened curtained window, (where you probably wouldn't 
dare wave at the neighbors, but could certainly if you tried)   and continuing our litany into one another's lives.
And that conversation will lead to a house that she desires 
to build in Armenia, probably along with Mom, a sister and 
a brother, and though I offered to buy, if I had the resour
ces at the moment, and live with Mom, sister and brother; t
hough she only agreed for a two to three day trial period, 
and to be tour guide if that was enough that either of us c
ould handle, though I thought it was quite amusing, she did
 seem sincere and made me promise if I did decide to go the
re that I would give her a call, and she even gave me the n
umber to her sister's house, where if I could not get in touch with her, I could call her home.
I think she somehow knew me from a past life, or she was tru
ly the incarnation of the last affair, though vaguely in he
ight and stature with a genuine politeness which caused me 
to almost literally beg her, after taking the time while in
 the shower sponging down my back with soap and warm water,
 to come back in so that I could have the pleasure of retur
ning such a sweet gesture.  And after a nice shower on a wa
rm Dubai afternoon,  I made her lay down with only bath tow
el so that I could easily message her back and shoulders, w
hich I was glad that she seemed to have relaxed from as she
 lay quiet and still.  After a few moments of hoping, while
 on top of her, that she was truly enjoying one of the many
 gifts that we had shared with one another since meeting do
wnstairs only hours ago, she opened her eyes, where in that
 very instant while enjoying the pleasure of having my fing
ers sink into the nice, soft and pink flesh of a fragile fr
ame, I could hear her quiet request that would have me reac
h over, while still on top as she is now laying on her back
 and now looking at me while I'm now slowly but passionatel
y making love to her and add a sweet melody to love making.
  And though I tried to escape; only in mind without attemp
ting at this plea that would give love immortality and tant
alize the soul, she would not release me.  And as I slowly 
and articulately strummed, as if a virtuoso, she also, to t
he rhythm of the guitar, the request, the acceptance, the p
erformance of having one hand lightly upon her shoulder, an
d the other at her request to melody which we both desired 
as she lay holding me inside of her; condoning her approval
.  And as I and Heaven's orchestra conclude only the music 
which we had created for her, I grabbed her in my arms and 
as my fingers slid off of the last string, no longer with t
he discipline to restrain lust, love and passion, now grabb
ing both of her legs; she, now grabbing both of my arms, wi
th a sincere, lustful and passionate smile, in a low and intense roar, bringing us back from the duns of beautiful Dubian dessert.
She said that she wanted a gift from me; and it is always on
 my mind, though many times I forget to share something las
ting that will make someone truly remember you and the time
 that was shared.  I hadn't been shopping much and had brou
ght only one suitcase with me, but hurried over as we were 
about to head back downstairs, opened it up and began to se
arch fervidly, and ironically remembered that last time I w
as there, just before heading to France for a week, that I 
had bought what the sells lady told me was called a martyr'
s ring.  there was a young lady sitting at a table with me 
one day or so before I left to catch the plane, and she was
 playing with a ring that she had taken off of her finger a
nd then rolling it from one hand to other on the table, and
 it accidentally rolled my way; catching it before it rolle
d to the edge of the table and politely handing it back to 
her.  Therefore while I was visiting one of the temple near
 the famous Place de la Concorde, L'Ã©glise Sainte-Marie-Ma
deleine  (The Church of Saint Mary Madeleine))   where just
 after entering through the archway, there was a small conc
ession, I bought one for myself, and couldn't help but thin
k about how cute it was seeing the young lady playing with 
the ring, and though I knew that I would probably not see h
er again, I bought another one, saying that I would give it
 to her, or would certainly give it to one of the lovely yo
ung ladies there, which I'm sure they would have enjoyed.  
But I searched, and couldn't find it; I bring it up because
 I recently did find it, and wondered why I didn't see it w
hen wanting to give it to Rita.  But there was a pair of pr
etty little slippers that I had bought for my niece, with t
he head of one of the cute cartoon characters on it, which 
I'm sure she would have known which one it was; and thus th
ought twice, and felt that the extra special meaning behind
 it would make the perfect gift to give to her, where she i
mmediately put them on and truly enjoyed wearing them.  So 
I grabbed a small bag and placed them in it for her before giving her a kiss and a hug good-bye.
I met Rita a few times after that...; and as I said, this is only a brief story of our first meeting.
Love, Otadom

3 The Princess Travels Through The Eye Of The Storm Desiree Rivers Thomas Prose Bio 

The day's tumultuous events caused Poreris to drift back to 
when his niece, Desiree, was a little girl, and remembering
 her Uncle, Bill; her dad's brother who would come over and
 visit.  One day while she was lying on the bed watching te
levision, he walked into the room and began to talk to her.
  Just before walking into the room, he pulled a Laura Bush
 biography of the shelf with the intentions of having her r
ead a few pages for him, simultaneously trying to create an
 atmosphere and cordial pattern of picking up a book when s
he has free time, on the weekends when a child thinks, and 
should think that it's time to forget everything that happe
ned academically, and without a doubt during the summer whe
n most things will discretely fade out through the osmosis of a long, hot, relaxing vacation.
Her grandmother had a small bookshelf at the end of the hall
 way, about two or three shelves of books; each of a differ
ent genre; half that her Uncle Bill put there himself after
 reading, from Poe, to Melville, to an autobiography of the
 former Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Colin Powel, who
 once said how ironic it was that his dad never owned a gun
, yet his son becomes head of the most powerful military in
 the world; to Hillary Clinton a modern day female activist
, former first lady and senator of New York.  At that momen
t, also trying to show by example, how to take the time and
 have reading becoming an entertaining event as well as an 
academic one, and thus he had also brought with him and was
 in the middle of a fourteen hundred and fifty page novel b
y Victor Hugo; Les Mieserables, though right about at the h
alfway point he said that he wished that he had either take
n a speed reading course or had bought the abridged version
.  And Condoleezza Rice, which he was telling a young lady 
named Shay that he met in Atlanta one day while passing thr
ough, whom he had a chance to have supper with one evening,
 that just halfway through the autobiography of her, Condol
eezza Rice, that it had made him dizzy; she, as they say, h
as been everywhere and done everything, from a professor at
 Stanford University to Secretary of State; coming from a s
mall conservative Christian family, and becoming a diligent
 female role model.  He would have given her it to read, but he was only halfway through and refused to let it go.
Desiree would remember him saying that 'He wasn't certain ho
w they; kids viewed time, and how they saw it in relationsh
ip to the future; their future'.  They say that they have n
o true concept of time, or that was the teacher's way back 
then of explaining to us of how we sometimes seemed oblivio
us to the controlling of fate and manipulation of our desti
nies, the dreams of being teachers, firemen, doctors, lawye
rs and politicians attained rather than hoped for.'  She wo
uld hand him her progress report card, and it had mainly A's and B's, which he would say, 'That's great'.
At her age, and probably in the same classroom that she was 
now sitting in on a day to day basis, about thirty years ag
o, he ran down those same halls, and since the outside of t
he building had not changed very much, Poreris could precis
ely imagine seeing them there and literally speak of her an
d her cohorts walking back and forth from class to class an
d even stopping for lunch in the cafeteria, and could also 
remember what the inside of Othello Price's office, the hea
d principle, looked like, unfortunately from being more tru
ant than academic, though he was certain that he left the a
cademy with a B average.  And thus most likely from that po
int, although not having graduated from a university, thoug
h he may have had about a couple of hundred credit hours fr
om different schools and universities, and was still in the
 process of thinking about attaining a degree in some field
 between then and retirement, thus believing by that time i
n her life as it was in his, the pattern of having the abil
ity and desire for learning, should have begun to become so
mewhat of a fixed foundation; though at that moment he had more of a conviction to a stern work ethic.
There was also an autobiography about three hundred pages lo
ng, which was of George W. Bush; the president.  And his wi
fe about two hundred pages long, so he grabbed it; the one 
on his wife, Laura Bush; a light paperback, with vital info
rmation from a cultural to a political perspective, by a female role model, and thus Desiree began to read page one.
Because the First Lady was a librarian, a teacher, and had a
lso formed and chaired a reading program, it was probably w
ritten to capture the attention of the youth as well, somet
hing that could easily be assigned as a reading project by 
either a teacher or parent.  Therefore there were only a nu
mber of words that she needed help with as he sat there lis
tening to her read aloud.  He did the same with The Little 
Princess, one of the first books that he had bought her tha
t he eventually read himself, thinking that he should not o
nly buy them books, but just about read every page of each one that he had gotten them, and enjoy it equally as much.
TV is educational, the radio can equally be as informative a
s entertaining, and sitting down with a good book somewhat 
helps make a complete and healthy mind, though the lack of 
seeing them not as often enough with the latter is what pro
mpted his interest in how they; Desiree and her brother, we
re doing academically.  He would say, ' I guess if you do g
ood in school, and not do the latter of the above, reading 
as much as possible whenever the opportunity presents itself, it should be a forced extracurricular home chore'.
'Desiree, you are eleven years old, born June the 26th 1992,
 and I was fortunate enough to see you as a new born infant
 even before leaving the hospital; and seeing you over the 
years as your dad's only baby daughter, and only three year
s younger than your brother, and seeing y'all, who up until
 recently, looked almost like twins, talked alike and acted
 alike, though the only difference is due to the stronger w
ill of biology that separates the two of you at the moment as you mature into young men and women.'
And while sitting there listening and thinking about the las
t eleven years of her life as an uncle and friend, he began
 to notice how she had become taller, as she held the book 
in her hands.  He first noticed how long and slender her fi
ngers were; only a few days earlier, he had made her brothe
r hold up his hand against his; at fifteen, he was just abo
ut as tall as his Uncle Bill and her fingers were just as l
ong although more slender, and stopped her in the middle of
 reading and placed her palm against his and told her that 
she would probably be a doctor or a lawyer; that's what people use to say to those whom had unique hands.
Then he began to notice how much she had grown; he had alway
s said that she and her brother had that athletic physique,
 thus noticing her legs, then arms, listening how she read 
while in reverie of the past eleven years that he had known

A Brief Bio In Rhymes 

Though i live far south of Claraghatlea my first home place
Where mine years ago was a well known face
Since the years have left me looking older and gray
Perhaps there i would be a stranger today
I have traveled a bit in my sixty six years life span
And though i have been to New Zealand and Britain and Japan
I have not been to Paris or Berlin or Rome
Big Cities not distant from my first Irish home
As a  teenager i lived and worked in New York for a few years
Where for Claraghatlea i did shed nostalgic tears
And here in Koroit in Victoria where i live today
The clock on my life does keep ticking away
Worked in woods in Muskerry and Duhallow felling spruce and pine trees
In temperatures often close to zero degrees
Worked on building sites and as a drainer and in the old Sherbrooke Shire
On travel towers lopping trees i worked hard for my hire
A brief bio in rhyme  of  my life that and  little else more
And i do feel my age now six years with three score
I have  traveled a bit since my life's journey began
But compared to some i am not a well traveled man.

An Auto Bio Of A Girl 

I was brutally beaten up by a beast
Whom my mother brought in home
When I was thirteen
Instead of being grown in love and care
Since then I continued to bleed
As immediacy next year
I was raped by my neighbour
Instead of playing in the fields
I was bleeding between my legs
Now at the age of twenty four
I bleed from my eyes
As they show my rape- movie every day at night
I can not remain awake
The haunting scenes flashed back as memories
Nor I go for sleep as  my  dream plays back
What I have stored in my memories
Already twice I took knife
To cut short this horrible life
But each time I failed to say good byes
As appears the face of my child in my eyes.

Bio Energy 

Energy exists in different forms:
Thermal energy, electrical energy,
Magnetic energy, chemical energy,
Wind energy, solar energy and et al.
Bio-energy consists of chemical,
Thermal, electric, magnetic energy.
Bio-energy confines to bodies
And is distinct from their counterparts
That exist outside the living bodies
In that it as a unit cannot exist
Without the living mass in any way,
That it ceases when bodies disintegrate,
And that it transmits through reproduction.
Bio-energy is only expandable.

Bio Iii 

Once a time upon itself,
The wave of conception had blown
And outweighed a fair self,
Who to pregnance was loaned.
Then she did bore a berry,
That's achetyped to the southern cherry.
(It's shape like the mortal,
And his wits like the immortal.)
What was brought forth by the self,
Was no other person but my veryself.
And then i'd grown and still growing.
The berry is now in poetry glowing.
And one day the berry would be ripe for the teeth,
And either death or rapture shall eat it.

Bio Ii 

A tale of a human God,
Whose tail with immortality coiled.
He'd left his cloak beyond,
And visited an hemisphere to lend one.
Rag of rags was he girded in:
Not by force, but his unwilling wish.
He'd made a league with the reserved,
And even battered himself for the undeserved.
He's yet who he is,
Though many call him a name that's not his.
He's Yahuah's salvation,
(For blessed is he who come
In the name of Yahuah; his form)
But 'Jesus' had many taken him to be in misconception.
He'd done his task, and removed the scar,
He's no one than 'YAHUSHUA'.

Celestials and the Inhuman.
He'd paved a path priced per pint
Of fame, emptied on his footprint.
He'd travelled not by leg, but by wits through spheres.
He's none but WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.

Bio My Grandfathers Hand 

One of the oldest families
Best known for their good Irish name;
Lived in this house on this land,
Grandsons planned to do the same.
Three worn, corner-chipped, porch steps
Stacked up to an aging screen door
That squeaked when I opened it,
Closed slowly as I crossed the floor.
A pull chain lit the darkness
In the small bedroom I called mine;
Where I dreamed of tomorrow,
Thought out how I'd cross finish lines.
The back yard was my sports field,
Had shade trees and low limbs to dodge;
Cement strips weeds grew between
Led from the street to this garage.
This house won't last forever
And strangers might live on this land;
But folks won't forget me
'Cause they shook my grandfather's hand.

Why do you blame your Creator?

You yourself go to a volcano's crater,
Ninety nine times you complete your adventure,
Safe and sound, you come back with a famous name,
But once you fall you get no time for regret and shame!
Why do you blame Satan, he is now old and tired,
He now bows his head before the bio terrorists,
A handsome pension he gets, he has been retired,
By capitalists, communists, and religious extremists,
Made of fire, sleeps in the volcano with no more desires
Made of clay, sleepless in the in the self-ignited fires!

Brief Bio Of Mario Vitales Poetry 

The language and images of Mario Vitale's poetry are so clos
ely bound to the natural cycles of seasons, of generations,
 of the body's functioning, that is surprising to realize h
ow many of his poems deal with uprootedness. But this poetr
y is not sentimental celebration of the goodness of nature,
 and harmony with the world is never assumed. The way he ca
ptures the tenuousness of this faith, the balance that must
 be found between the ugliness, the harshness of his histor
y- both natural annd social- and its intense beauty, is what distinguishes Vitale's poetry, gives it its depth and dimension:
Vitale was born in 1970 Bristol hospital.
A young nurse took me in her arms and said that I would one day become a success,
As the years would pass I was heavy in the arts used to sing and act.
Was an altar boy at St. Pius Church.
In time I would act in my senior class play, "The Mystery Of Edwin Drood"
Where I had the lead role as the Narrator,
I touched many hearts with that performance in 1989,
Was hospitalized with mono that same year for two weeks long,
Also that same year I became prom king of my class Wolcott High School,
After the break up with my first grilfriend in 1989 I wrote 
the poem entitled, "Remembrance of a loved one" where I had it published on poetry.com
As the years passed I would write over 4,000 poems and 5 short stories toward my platform,
My poetry is based on the free verse style of writing,
Was published in 10 venues such as Writerscafe, Neopoet, Hel
lo poetry, Poem Hunter, Booksie, Poetryvibe, Poetrysoup, Starlifecafe.com, Poets Know It & poetry.com...
I was saved by God at the tender age of nine in Charlotte Carolina where I came to know the Lord that was in 1979,
Today I continue to write poetry was published on Spillwords, High On Poetry, Tuck Magazine & Setu Magazine.
My main emphasis in writing poetry is to share with the mass populace touching many hearts.

Heaven cries, the people are crippled
on whom it relies, crippled of the mind
eyes opened but blind, to the necessary
evil plaguing our hearts, pulling us apart
from the love shared from above, making us
teach corruption instead of salvation
Sundays has become boring, I get tired
of pretending to be listening to all those
false teachings and preachings and doctrines
that I wonder where they come from,
was it not the same bible I read this morn'
so where did you get that interpretation from
I kindly ask you dear one.
And they tell me everyone's got a different understanding
I tried but they pushed me aside
I corrected them, but I became a problem
So I just chill every Sunday morning
Realizing this problem is without solving
And I leave them all to God
When we die, we'll be judged based on our records

I need to get out of here
As fast as I can,
And surround myself with the personifications
Of nature in the tallest of forests
Innocent of patriarchal gravity,
Or mothering worries and caveats:
For, if I followed the tresses and the bounding
Play of my hounds, I might find an open meadow,
Like a theatre or green mouth,
And lay back inside that sloping throat, as
The clouds passed like insouciant thoughts
Where there were no ghosts bigger than my hand,
Where truth ambled with happy lovers perpetually
Unjaded by the higher catastrophes of people
Bound by obligations and savage business habits.

Bucolic Verse 

Goats are in the shed
Cows are near hedge,
Calves are loudly baaing
Sheep are bleating,
Farmer's daughter fails
To concentrate on cooking,
Farmer returns from land
No food he does get.

Love Untouched Bucolic 

Her body is a melting pot
On the silken sheet
with pillow beneath
trying hard to hold spinning head
temperature falling
heartbeat rising
body heat ignites the fumes
smell of love
in the air and everywhere
my wishes spiral bind the body and mind
hairs like desert of vast eternity
with dunes of desires
silken arms making waves and
despair was meager to obliterate
yearning to slurp those juicy lips
yet he dare not to ignite mutual flames.

Superstitions Bucolic Verse 

These carefree spirits,
thrive on the weak minds
Who falls prey to superstition,
they believe in.
Ah, these poor chaps,
they know not,
That these so called saints,
will suck their blood,
And will take them to task,
by creating smoke screens,
And will make life miserable,
making return uphill task,
And till the time they live,
will serve as unpaid slaves,
Do not follow them blindly,
Into a tunnel which has no lights.

The Sage Bucolic Love 

Although she was not found nor aware
We executed the sage bucolic love,
Stripping balances off reflections
Becoming (for)her streams of immanency;
We executed the sage bucolic love.
This is how I lost the room,
The more one itself was acute,
The room where we fell out of love;
We executed the sage bucolic love.
The only true love story;
If not lost, told...

A Burlesque On Liberalization 

Long live the freedom newly found
Far below has been left the ground,
Drinking the elixir of liberalization,
Have we forgotten all human sensations?
Live and let others live, motto we had
Our prosperity we often used,
For not so lucky as ordained
By culture & sacraments we had gained.
Liberated now is our greed for wealth,
No one is left to repose the faith,
In moral values like selflessness,
Really oh God, we are in a mess.
It's time wake up for liberalization
From grred to keep-up our traditions.

Beware of artists sons of imagery

With nationalization as it's fence.
So beware oh artists, bear in mind
Produce art pieces with specialization,
Not insulting the laws of the nation.

With the consent of high power commtt,
Which will contain specialized people,
Who will be defamed sons of brutality
Who can destroy you with a browbit only.

Burlesque1725 

Dear beautiful lady
the poor devil very humbly thanks you
for your two melons and prays for you
to content yourself with his small thanks.
He would like to send you some wonder
because wonder he names Melons.
But in a man of his kind from whom
nothing comes out and nothing comes in
he goes nuts for wonderful melons.
If only your beautiful eyes
his house would light would be very well.
So just please truth be told from little thanks.
And if that is insufficient pierce me at an angle
with a sharp dart and may my heart be skewered
on the spot.
May I love you with all my soul.
Do not doubt ebony bait nor my eyes
spearing your melons.

Burlesque On Nationalization1 

Oh peaches store ample beauty aids
Thus, for a long your charm you can guard.
Beware oh glamour aided by beauty aids
We are nationalizing them within short period.
Monopoly then will be with the government
Officials will decide the cream for you best.
Lip sticks will be kept then in State Banks
Talcs will be found with treasury's trade mark.
You have to apply then for every beauty aid
Straight to the justices with tiny bench.
The quota of your cloths will be sanctioned
On recommendations of anti beauty branch.

Burlesque 

Burlesque they did detest.
So they stood outside the club to protest.
They were surprised when their pastor came out with a smile.
They couldn't believe that this was his style.
He told them that he was there to save the dancers' souls.
His story smelled more like dead fish than a rose.

Burlesque
~
Sequins shimmer in the lights
While music builds a sensual rhythm
The move and sway of the dance
As the ladies begin to hypnotize
A celebration of the female form
In all of its beauty the eyes are held
Watching intent as the show unfolds
The smile and the look upon the stage
How the dancers enjoy their play
The little sway of the hips
As they turn and twist the audience
The strut in their stride tells
This is after all their night
One to which they knew belonged
To the evocative and sensual
To all that is beautiful

Burlesque 

i can't think of anything
More boring, stupifying and soul deadening
Than wasting one's time
Watching hardcore pornography
But Burlesque
Done tastefully
With good acessories
That gets down to the nitty
But not all the way
To the gritty
Can be entertaining
While still leaving something
For the imagination
Maybe I'm old-fashioned
But I still think that's important.

Burlesque Sonnet To A Bee 

Sweet Insect! that on two small wings doth fly,
And, flying, carry on those wings yourself;
Methinks I see you, looking from your eye,
As tho' you thought the world a wicked elf.
Offspring of summer! brimstone is thy foe;
And when it kills ye, soon you lose your breath:
They rob your honey; but don't let you go,
Thou harmless victim of ambitious death!
How sweet is honey! coming from the Bee;
Sweeter than sugar, in the lump or not:
And, as we get this honey all from thee,
Child of the hive! thou shalt not be forgot.
So when I catch, I'll take thee home with me,
And thou shall be my friend, oh! Bee! Bee! Bee!

910 Cacophony To Peace 

I had strayed into cacophony from routine,
The din sounded like music to my ears,
Wasnâ€™t long, the blare consumed my attention,
I wasnâ€™t listening anymore, confused,
I was pushed from cacophony to silence,
I spent time, do not know how long,
I recovered from silence to hearing,
With the help of a lot of tender caring,
Every journey leaves you learned,
Few learning are hard earned,
Every learning has a cost,
Few learning leave you lost,
When I regained myself,
I looked around to assess,
My surroundings had changed,
I live in a different world now,
Itâ€™s a lot of peace out here,
I can hear birds chirping,
I can see children in the park playing,
I have started working and thinking.

A Sudden Bird Cacophony 

A sudden bird cacophony
Came to me like a symphony:
They each played their part; majors and minors,
Piping their art; well skilled and first timers.
And none were afraid, of the part which they played
As some flew around, and some sat in the shade
Of the trees in the glen, where they sang to the men
Of how time makes away, with the best of our days
And how bird song outlasts both our future and past.

Cacophony Of Harmony 

Peaceful serenity falls upon my mind, giving me food for tho

Letting go entirely of life, traipsing into forests of freed

Honing in on a cacophony of harmony, keeping pace with it's 
awesome ability to participate subconsciously and entirely in my intellectual abilities.
Accolades of strident triumphs giving me moments of inspired
 tones, guiding me through tangled jungles of brain cells, tumbling out into many exacting rhymes of verse.
Lifting my spirits, taking me away from earthly pursuits jus

Cacophony 

Hollow,
tide of the world has swept to me,
washing my thoughts, washing my mind.
This barage of opinion is vexatious,
the dumb, the daft, the dubious,
daring and dashing t'rite bay.
Truth is planted by the tip,
roots concealed in the clouds of heaven,
sweet tongues, sweet words,
vast as the oceans,
as the oceans, unswallowable,
or swallow the waters;
the desert cannot be more deserted,
save for the blinding sandstorm,
drowning, obstructing the journey north,
we journey not.
The wand of one is brutish,
same so see the word of many.

Cacophony 

My ink bleeds with a burning desire to tell the unspoken story that goes on in my head.
If only I could think of a sweet symphony to quench this raging cacophony in my pregnant mind.
I lay expectant in my pink pyjamas staring at the unperturbed Moon, for answers she refused to give.
The stars will not wink so my curiosity be tamed.
The link between the realm of uncertainty and reality is severed.
If I will but drink from the pot of Athena, I may send my anxiety to sleep.
I am at the brink of walking away from all I have toiled for.
If only the heavens can blink and give me a sign.
I fear I may sink in my cocoon till I find the answers I seek.

Loves Cacophony 

For a love which seems so simple
That with quiet ease it must ring true
A rousing chorus does sound
Which deafens the calls of sanity
Should love be an illness of the mind
A sick note to the heart
Let it play and be sung in my own
That I am maddened by the sounds
The words of love which speak
Make no sense but to themselves
The song of which this word does sing
Let me be lost in their melody
Confused in their chorus
And drawn to their verse
Oh the words and sounds of love
How simple they claim to be
I find myself happily lost
In loves cacophony

with white rice wrapped by coconut leaves)
nothing significant really like it is an ordinary day
but there is one thing that i cannot tell you
i have seen stars there,

that they are stars in their own right,
ordinariness felt

independent, open, nothing significant

Spare Me The Cacophony 

Spare me the cacophony of your caws, Mr. Crow
I am not a bit enamored of you, don't you know?
Why are you bent on stealing my precious serenity
Cawing away from the branches of the neem tree?
To the koel's melodious notes, let me listen
And admire the dewdrops that sparkle and glisten.
Let its magical music drive away my midnight blues
Before they return with some gory morning news.
Grand is the morning, grand the fragrant flowers
Grander the luscious fruit hanging from the bowers.
Let me be drenched in the magic of twilight dews
Before my blues return with gory morning news.
Trills she, "Koohoo, get up, you laggards lazy.
Go inject some sense in a world gone crazy."
Your off-key cawing does nothing but confuse
More depressing it is than the gory morning news.
There is nothing but senseless gore, ah so chilling
None wants to listen to the koel's soothing trilling.
Spare me the raucosity of your caws, Mr. Crow
Honestly, I'm not enamored of you, don't you know?

Sings heart's sorrow expecting urgent arrival.

Their Forlorn Cacophony 

Unfitted, the zoo sleeps well concealed;
The bachelors are moaning their ghazals,
Their lungs are wheezing like sick balloons,
Since they can see her through their bars;
She is that opulent moon,
Fully formed, the distant transmogrify,
Who delights in making love in front of their lonely cages,
To everything else, and in that nostalgic expanse,
She whispers to them she whispers her tugging form,
Where the sea rises in sharp nipples,
And laughs with her in their pornographic truancies,
Dancing in the drunken bolero beneath her armpit
Until they are trapped in the flowing penumbra,
One part of her thighs which lays across their
Foreheads like a feverish hand,
Touching them with her distant interests,
Until they learn her name,
The hoary spikenard come aware in their throats,
And cry it out in their forlorn cacophony.

(For human passions all have stirred my mind),
Have held me, now I feel and know, confined
Both from the true and good still far away.

And I am near to fail, infirm and weary.

La Canzone Delle Onde Dellisola 

Dopo una lunga assenza, oltre trenta anni,
Sono tornato dai penati per visitare la regione
E i cugini che non c'erano allora.
Ãˆ stato un piacere rivedere la mia cittÃ  con passione.
La sera arrivÃ², dopo un'importante riunione
Di famiglia.Era tempo di riposare sul divano
Chi mi ha ricordato la mia infanzia in questa casa.
Dopo il primo lungo sonno, ho ascoltato il vento
E le onde del mare in una coppia serafica. Lo ero
Trasportato da questa melodia dove mi sono sentito in pace.
Ero immerso, sepolto in un sogno taumaturgico.
Potrei guardare le onde del mare di Anse d'Hainault,
Che ha ispessito i granelli di sabbia. Mi sentivo a mio agio
Come un membro reale nel paradiso del cacique.

Last Lovecanzone 

Love hath a chamber all of imagery;
And there is one dim nook,
A little storied web wherein my heart
From leaf to leaf is read as in a book.
One part in the middle of the web begun and left unfinished;
a face with ravelled threads falling over it and hiding it. Love says
that the time has come to resume and finish this part of the web,
though much has come between since it was begun.
For the garlands of heaven were all laid by,
And the Daylight sucked at the breasts of a Lie.
The wounded heart and the dying swan
Were side by side
Where the rushes coil with the turn of the tideâ€”
The hart and the swan.
Withinthose eyes the sedulous yearning throe,
And all the evil of my heart
A thousand times forgotten.
Ah if you had been lost for many years,
And from the dead to-day were risen again!

Sonnet Iii Canzone Translated From Milton 

They mock my toil--the nymphs and am'rous swains--
And whence this fond attempt to write, they cry,
Love-songs in language that thou little know'st?
How dar'st thou risque to sing these foreign strains?
Say truly. Find'st not oft thy purpose cross'd,
And that thy fairest flow'rs, Here, fade and die?
Then with pretence of admiration high--
Thee other shores expect, and other tides,
Rivers on whose grassy sides
Her deathless laurel-leaf with which to bind
Thy flowing locks, already Fame provides;
Why then this burthen, better far declin'd?
Speak, Canzone! for me.--The Fair One said who guides
My willing heart, and all my Fancy's flights,
'This is the language in which Love delights.'

A Christmas Carol 

It chanced upon the merry merry Christmas eve,
I went sighing past the church across the moorland dreary-
'Oh! never sin and want and woe this earth will leave,
And the bells but mock the wailing round, they sing so cheery.
How long, O Lord! how long before Thou come again?
Still in cellar, and in garret, and on moorland dreary
The orphans moan, and widows weep, and poor men toil in vain,
Till earth is sick of hope deferred, though Christmas bells be cheery.'
Then arose a joyous clamour from the wild-fowl on the mere,
Beneath the stars, across the snow, like clear bells ringing,
And a voice within cried-'Listen!-Christmas carols even here!
Though thou be dumb, yet o'er their work the stars and snows are singing.
Blind! I live, I love, I reign; and all the nations through
With the thunder of my judgments even now are ringing.
Do thou fulfil thy work but as yon wild-fowl do,
Thou wilt heed no less the wailing, yet hear through it angels singing.'
Eversley, 1849.

A Christmas Carol 

TUNE--'God rest ye, merry gentleman.'
GOD rest ye, merry gentlemen; let nothing you dismay,
For Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was born on Christmas-day.
The dawn rose red o'er Bethlehem, the stars shone through the gray,
When Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was born on Christmas-day.
God rest ye, little children; let nothing you affright,
For Jesus Christ, your Saviour, was born this happy night;
Along the hills of Galilee the white flocks sleeping lay,
When Christ, the Child of Nazareth, was born on Christmas-day.
God rest ye, all good Christians; upon this blessed morn
The Lord of all good Christians was of a woman born:
Now all your sorrows He doth heal, your sins He takes away;
For Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was born on Christmas-day.

A Christmas Carol 

Babe Jesus lay in Mary's lap,
The sun shone in his hair;
And this was how she saw, mayhap,
The crown already there.
For she sang: 'Sleep on, my little king;
Bad Herod dares not come;
Before thee sleeping, holy thing,
The wild winds would be dumb.'
'I kiss thy hands, I kiss thy feet,
My child, so long desired;
Thy hands will never be soiled, my sweet;
Thy feet will never be tired.'
'For thou art the king of men, my son;
Thy crown I see it plain!
And men shall worship thee, every one,
And cry, Glory! Amen!'
Babe Jesus he opened his eyes wide-
At Mary looked her lord.
Mother Mary stinted her song and sighed;
Babe Jesus said never a word.

Come back, Dear Lord, a Second Time,
Your Loving Kindness is a Crime,

Your followers are quite insane.
Why should we want to be forgiven
And end up in your boring Heaven?
Come heal our sickness, heal our pain
And we'll nail You to the Cross again!
If you try a Resurrection
We'll finish you off with a lethal injection! !

A Christmas Carol 

Crows freeze in mid-flight
And hang there
Like fire damaged decorations.
In longboats farmers
Glide out to fodder
Tossing ballast with steel pronged
Oars to a pod of cattle
Bugling steam into the evening.
Along Broderick's hillcrest
A tribe of stooping pine
File east slower than Artic thaw
While daylight leaks
Through a star pricked sky.
Baby Jesus could you know
That between the bar door
And the midnight choir
Someone would urinate a crucifix
In this year's snow?

A New Christmas Carol 

Though Christmas comes once every year,
Lord Christ was born just once on earth;
The Virgin Mary gave Him birth,
And saved all mankind from sin's fear.
The day reveals God's love for man-
By being born in flesh, a boy;
This brings immense peace and great joy,
And adds true meaning to life-span.
Our Savior chose a bed of hay-
In Bethlehem's, a stable place;
Three Magi, shepherds saw His face,
As angels sang, where Jesus lay.
God's love was born in human form,
And hope afilled each human heart;
God's plan was laid right from the start,
To free mankind from satan's harm.

Sometimes I wonder in the dark still of night
About you laying cold and white
In sleeps repose, gowned yet dead
A shroud of pills about your head
Your debt to asclepius surely paid
Upon that bed so neatly made
You asked of me a simple task
Not much at all to really ask
Not money nor power, not even wine
Just a moment of my time
To read you a poem
I wonder sometimes in dark the still of night
If I had read you the poem

Dedicated to Carol who kept shop at the withlapoka community store

A Spring Carol 

The hot summer how did make me forget,
Those buds in spring whose I not know,
Earth be staring at sun and I be finding a date,
To claim her with stares and kiss and bow,
Those woods in yellow standing far alone,
All with rare hats and rarest glow,
And all shall be in dark when asks them none,
Like as in good times all try to show.
Long, long I stare at those listless bees,
With my true eyes that minutes not spare,
Then when a golden sunbird at them sees,
Both embrace in nuptials with their breasts, bare.
The more you stare at those glittering flowers,
The more heart shall wish to spend more hours.

Walmart, the modern day Scrooge tiz.
Billionaire Walton family
Cares only about greedy biz.
Their workers slave in poverty.
Some union backed Xmas ghosts do
Picket and strike the Walmart stores,
Relentless PR campaign to
Dry up the cash register drawers,
Force this Scrooge from such wicked ways,
Pay more wages, Walmart, or close.
No job's better the more it pays,
As any laid off worker knows.
Go elsewhere with the shopping cart.

The snow-capped hills I stare through,
And what I gaze beside a wood full of oaks,
Sculptured mists in each long bough,
With each twig of cuckoo and no more croaks,
And frozen waves like a white-manned troop,
As if they're blind and their shores in dark,
And far away drizzles with each one's own group,
O'er peerless beetles beneath all wet barks.
Sun's now hidden and nights in dream,
With light clouds at edges as black as ink,
And icy lakes with drowned man's sweet scream
And you go deep in it in each erroneous blink.
And what I see are joys in million gowns of dew,
All like happy tears of earth in an eon, new.

Behind The Barn With Carol Ann 

Back in 1957, kissing Carol Ann behind the barn in the middl
e of a windswept field of Goldenrod with a sudden deer watc
hing was something special, let me tell you. Back then, bobby sox and big barrettes and ponytails were everywhere.
Like many farmers, Carol Ann's father had a console radio in
 the living room, and every Saturday night the family would
 gather â€˜round with bowls of ice cream and listen to The 
Grand Ole Opry. It was beamed "all the way" from Nashville 
I was told more than once since I was from Chicago and sometimes wore a tie so how could I know.
On my first visit, I asked Carol Ann if the Grand Ole Opry w
as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir of country music and she sai
d not to say that to her father. She suggested I just tap m
y foot to the music and let him watch me. Otherwise, I'd be
st be quiet and say "Yup, " "Nope" or "Maybe" if asked any 
questions which she didn't think would happen. No need to s
ay much more, she said, and after a few visits, I understood why.
Over time, I learned to tap my foot pretty good to the music
 because when I'd come to visit, her father would insist I 
have a bowl of ice cream with the family. I liked the ice c
ream but not so much the Grand Ole Opry. I'd been weaned on Sinatra in the city. Big difference, let me tell you.
But back in 1957 kissing Carol Ann behind the barn was somet
hing special since we couldn't do much more until I found e
mployment. Only then, her father said, could we get married
. I found no jobs in town, however, for a bespectacled man with degrees in English.
Still, I always found the weekend drives from Chicago worth 
the gas my Rambler drank because kissing Carol Ann brought 
a bit of heaven down behind that barn, especially on summer
 nights when fireflies were the only stars we saw when our 
eyes popped open. It was like the Fourth of July with tiny sparklers twinkling everywhere.
Now,55 years later, Carol Ann sometimes mentions fireflies a
t dusk as we dance behind the cows to coax them into the ba
rn for the night. I'm still not too good with cows despite 
my John Deere cap, plaid shirt and overalls which proves, s
he says, that all that kissing behind the barn in 1957 took the boy out of the city but not the city out of the boy.
"Hee Haw" is all I ever say in response because I know why I
'm there. It's to keep tapping the cows on the rump till we
 get them back in the barn so we can go back in the house a
nd start with a kiss and later on come back downstairs for two big bowls of ice cream.

Carol Burnett A Tribute 

Against all odds you rose
To reach your many dreams
And turned around the words of those
Who had no faith in you, it seems.
Indeed, you found your place
Where you gave what you had best,
Put so much laughter on my face
I was blessed by your comic jest.
The years had seen you bloom
Where the stage had been so kind
In our homes you always had room
No funnier lady I could find.
I'd like to thank you for the laughs
The shows that bring back memories
And your life did more than enough
To touch it somehow with cheers.

In the midnight chill,

Dropped a rose of gold.

When 'twas bitter winter,
Houseless and forlorn

Her Name Is Of A Velvet Carol 

Her Name Is Of A Velvet Carol
Her name is of a velvet carol, and although her billows reign above
The ocean that commands all suitors, she chooses only one for love.
She is eloquent and knows her verses will outlive her bygone tears;
In a sunlit carriage she calmly rides throughout the crimson colored years,
To the melody of lullabies in woods where the scent of belvederes
Reminds her of Byron, Shelley, his Lady Fair, Wordsworth - and me.
For once she let her hair down, in its long and raven sublimity,
And touched me with those sacred lips, of hyacinths, of the sacred rose.
She awaits for me in paradise, as patient as a statue's pose.
And as the moonlight falls into the starry, diamond fountain,
Where I wander in a daze, in the square beneath the mountain,
I behold her in a wondrous haze, when all is still in a gilded bliss,
Where the shadows of oleanders mystically sway,
Where all of heaven's angels intercede for us and pray;
My love and I shall walk - forever in a kiss.

At Christmas i have been listening to it since i was knee height
And i cannot say it fills me with a sense of delight

And among the congregation not an atheist in sight

And at Christmas sung in every language Worldwide in every village and city and town
And though the sentiments in the words and the music in the carol one can only admire
Of listening to it repeatedly sung over Christmas i for one tend to tire
But we all look at things in a different way
And it is each to their own as the wise one does say

Cascade 

What sort of arrow split the sky and this rock?
It's quivering, spreading like a peacock's fan
Like the mist around the shaft and knot less feathers
Of a comet come to nest at midnight.
How blood surges from the gaping wound,
Lips already silencing murmur and cry.
One solemn finger holds back time, confusing
The witness of the eyes where the deed is written.
Silence? We still know the passwords.
Lost sentinels far from the watch fires
We smell the odor of honeysuckle and surf
Rising in the dark shadows.
Distance, let dawn leap the void at last,
And a single beam of light make a rainbow on the water
Its quiver full of reeds,
Sign of the return of archers and patriotic songs.
END

Cascade 

This clod of earth that I call mine
is only dust and dirt,
Until your overflowing water
spills the green upon the brown.
Your whirls and eddies soak the ground
of this awaiting garden.
My breath dries to crackles and sparks
the air inside my jar.
Your mist and clouds discharge my fret
with gentle laughing rain.
Your waters dance and splash abandon
over all my hard-baked cares.
Ego-fire drives to level
all I really love.
Its flaming mouth would eat the world
and stand alone apart;
But that monster cannot pass
the river of your heart.

Cascade 

Cascade
She threw cascades of rainbow colored flowers
Down the street as she hopped and skipped down it.
My gosh it was splendid.
For a secret she only knew why.
Let me see.
It was someone's birthday
Or wedding anniversary or anything of that sort.
But my oh my it was gorgeous.
The cascade of flowers were pretty.

Ceaseless Cascade Of Memories 

Rolling, racing faster and faster, voices singing, taking
me along pathways of rhythm so placid and soothing.
Caressing this heart, letting it beat in time with rhythms
being listened to.
So intensely falling into this mind with designs flowing
into and over patterns, so delicate and interesting.
Beautiful sensations lifting desires to the forefront,
applying the most brilliant colors to poetry that is being
written.
Hues flowing over every note, gathering and collecting them
so quickly and rapidly, keeping time with every beat.
Solitary peace, giving an essence to passion that is already
within.
Carefully, exercising intellect as it wafts breezily into the
sky blue atmosphere, nothing standing in the way of meanings,
definitions coming into mind.
A ceaseless cascading of memories, images, and visions,
filling me constantly with their incessant beats.

You think of me

Early Cascade 

I couldn't have waited. By the time you return
it would have rotted on the vine.
So I cut the first tomato into eighths,
salted the pieces in the dusk
and found the flesh not mealy (like last year's)
or bitter,
even when I swallowed the green crown of the stem
that made my throat feel dusty and warm.
Pah. I could have gagged on the sweetness.
The miser accused by her red sums.
Better had I eaten the dirt itself
on this the first night in my life
when I have not been too busy for my lonelinessâ€”
at last, it comes.

Methinks, its part is not hating,

In The Cascade Gardens 

In the Cascade Gardens from here far away
The lorikeets chirp in the bright sun of day
And the male green southern fig bird I fancy I hear
The gray brown mottled female to him perched near.
The song of the pied butcherbird one cannot mistake
In Spring he sings in the early dawn before daybreak
And the unmistakeable white ibis for scraps of food scavenge around
With their long bills they cannot probe for slugs in the sun hardened ground.
On the trees by the river gray with heads of light brown
The fruit bats in their thousands roost hanging upside down
At nightfall they venture out and even travel far
To the orchards and gardens where ripened fruits are.
In the Cascade Gardens I fancy I see
Sunbathers in swim wear walking home from the sea
When the cool breeze at evening from the saltwater blow
The memories remain of a place I did know.
Memories of the Cascade Gardens are living in me
The magpie is singing on the wattle tree
The sun brightly shining in the clear blue sky
And the gray noisy miners they chirp as they fly.

Sa chute Ã  pic, en casse-cou,
Son ruement lourd de cataracte.

Reflections from the sun, on the waters parade
Cold, jet stream, falling from grace

Of this flowing essence, caressing the ground
It runs endlessly, to enchant and entice
This cascade in the midst, and middle of paradise.

The Fall Of The Cascade 

I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys (Solomonâ€™s songs of songs)
The fall of a cascade
The water in the depths of the spring of her heart had grown completely dry
Many would pass by in hope to taste these waters
But would abstain after they realized it was now dry
They often gathered among themselves
Trying to gather a conclusion
Her waters once produced chaste waters theyâ€™d say
So they asked: who dried up the cascade?
A sigh released as I replied:
One day a man in a mask wandered by her waters
Opening the dams of her heart
He entered and soiled what once was bountiful and pure
By the time the dams of her heart attempted to close, she realized they had been broken
Euphoria no longer greets her lips
Loveâ€™s rain no longer falls
Thus the cascade began to dry.
They looked on in bewilderment and pointing at the waters they replied:
But behold, her waters are slowing rising.

The Fruit Bats Of Cascade Gardens 

In the Cascade Gardens at Broadbeach a South Queensland coastal Town
The fruit bats in their thousands roost hanging upside down
There must be twenty thousand and that is just a guess
And if you pressed me further i'd say there's more than less.
The fruit bats or flying foxes the name most know them by
Leave their roost in the evening when darkness cloak the sky
In search of fruit and wild figs they fly for miles around
And return before daybreak to their trees on roosting ground
The fruit bats on their roosting trees quite often disagree
And if one is evicted he fly to other tree
To rest near friendlier neighbour who will allow him space
In fruit bat pecking order each find their rightful place.
The fruit bats of Cascade Gardens dark wings and heads of brown
On trees along by the river roost hanging upside down
In search of fruit and wild figs they fly for miles around
And return before daybreak to their trees on roosting ground

Wonderful Cascade 

My sweetheart you are a wonderful cascade
Your beauty makes entire surrounding glade
In hot summer burning sun you are like shade
In lovers reckoning you are of superior grade
My love is in trance as your beauty swayed
My soul takes to be cut with sharp blunt blade
Your glowing cheeks have launched just a raid
At peril of my life the eternal price I just paid
Like moon in stars your sweet beauty outstayed
With your beauty in my veins I have to renegade
My love is like a music and your beauty serenade
Your beauty is eternal but my love is just to fade

A Boy Fishing Cavatina Sequence 

Alone he watches the water ripple,
without movement
he waits with the line going in quite deep,
in a moment
the muddy water stirs in little circles,
tense enjoyment
goes through the boy as line sings, starts running,
he jerks the rod, the fish jumps, it's stunning
with its golden silver scales glittering,
it dips under
and the fight is on as it twists and turns,
quick like thunder
again it jumps and twists back to escape,
without blunder
the boy reels in, still better hooking it,
over the river fighting bit by bit.

A Mans Life Is Like Mist Cavatina Poem 

Rich or poor in life, have this in common:
all turn to dust.
For the grave is the destiny of men
and die we must.
No one lives forever, that is the truth
that's firmly set
Wealth, fame, and health we cannot take with us
when we meet Death.
The proud are silenced and soon forgotten,
embraced by earth.
The good repaid with the joy of heaven's
eternal worth.
A man's life is like mist that's here today.
In death he is dust that winds blow away.

As A Pretty Butterfly That Flutters Cavatina Sequence 

As a pretty butterfly that flutters
along she came,
rapidly always running up and down;
nothing could tame
that childish sweet happy rushing spirit;
her lovely name
is not heard anymore as she is gone,
from life into death she has moved on.
Some soothing summer sunshine must be lost,
she does not pass,
no small shadow falls or lingers at times;
outside the grass
is quite soft where her small feet once did tread,
like clear bright glass
the sky is clear without a single fleck;
from her I cannot my sad thoughts direct.

Because Pain Stayed Rather Too Long Cavatina Poem 

Perhaps because Pain stayed rather too long
it made me numb.
I've faced it so often that to coldness
now I succumbed.
Strange how the constancy of tears may seem

And it's true the heart gets used to it,
always breaking.
Happiness looks far like the distant sun,
no longer warm.
I go on blind and deaf to love for it
has lost its charm.
The heart can only take so much and learns.
Some find true love, some don't, and some get burned.

I did not seek death but she came along,

in passing looked at me wearily;

she was a entrancing, lewd, lascivious
kind of being;
who really did love destruction and war,
she promised to visit me once more.
She said that all of her kisses and bliss
would transport me
into a unknown distant restful place,
eternity
was one of her many vague promises,
from her grasp free
grenades, rockets, shells detonated
while still in vain, with longing, she waited.

her arm hairs did rise at his very touch.
Pain had brought senselessness it was too much,
madness some say,

a judgement day,
at the very edge he was lingering
as if still waiting there for something.

would burst through the earth, would no season mar,

Poppies Cavatina 

Red they bloom as if coals from flaming hell,
they do glitter,
are shivering in the slight wind, I do
sometimes titter
at their emblazing beauty, while bees buzz,
birds do twitter;
God must have made them to be so lovely,
they awake feelings of longing in me.

Prayer Cavatina 

Words spoken in thoughts silently or loud
do travel beyond
the hemisphere, space, to the Lord of grace;
there is a bond
that is unseen, that's between man and God,
that corresponds
in conversations with a Godly being
while all other things fall somewhere in-between.

Pretoria Cavatina 

(after William Blake)
I walk the street, impoverished people
do catch my eye,
marks of hardship and woe are on their faces,
whores wander by,
(some once decent women forced to sin) ,
a baby's cry
sounds very helpless and I have pity,
there is some great heartache that I see.

Proof Of Existing Hell Cavatina In Answer To Czeslaw Milosz 

As soldiers we have smelt the scorching flames

have stories to tell of a kind of hate,
when mere boys are thrown to the care of fate.

Report From A Commander Of A Ratel Armoured Car Cavatina

From my mere childhood I was called-up

never free

Sandpiper Cavatina 

(after Elizabeth Bishop)
The leaping spray that roar, the swishing fling

it understands
the roaring toss, a world of surf and foam,
while rushing on the wet beach it does roam.

She Stays Lingering With Me Cavatina

Sprouting Like Strings Of Purple Morning Glories Cavatina 

Sprouting like strings of purple morning glories

Still In My Life You Do Enter In Cavatina

I am at times full of the vilest sin

Stopping At The Woods On A Snowy Evening Cavatina 

(after Robert Frost)
In passing the nearby snow filled great woods

the sheer loveliness caught the riderâ€™s eye;

a spell in each flake
brought tiredness, but the horse moved on,
breaking that old spell, its magic was gone.

The Art Of Poetry Cavatina Sequence In Answer To Archibald Macleish 

A poem should touch, should palpable belong,
it should reach out,
with a kind of eternal caring truth;
it should scream, shout
of each injustice and pain that do remain
and be about
almost anything or each happening,
as something that is truly worth saying.
Not silent or dumb it falls on the ear,
as it's profound,
in a great symphony of the purest
kind of clear sound,
its rhythms do ring with every line
it is not bound
by politics, machinations of men
and can be a blessing or an omen.

The Confused Mind Cavatina Poem 

Some jokers make me laugh at their folly,
without words said.
At Oscars night one did,when he wore a tux
and dress instead.
The clown felt grand with all the attention,
swirling his skirt.
But he had nothing of a woman's form
under his shirt.
These jesters make fools of themselves always,
and want respect.
They can flaunt their perverted views on us -
these we reject.
The Confused pretend but the truth is there.
They change clothes and body..... their mind, never.

On the sandstone veranda I saw him

Two Sides To Everything Cavatina 

(after Judith Rodriguez)
Some devious fiends hold to the statement
that there's two sides
to everything and to each viewpoint.
Some horror hides
in oppression in this very principle,
forcing to abide
as a true view sheer inhumanity,
anti-Semites killed millions gladly,
said they were only doing their duty,
and then to blame
they left a whole nation while they had fled,
in the great name
of patriotism, for the fatherland,
they brought great shame
and while they just meant extremely well,
they sent innocents straight to fiery hell.

Will Nature At A Time Be Really Lost Cavatina Sequence 

(after Archibald MacLeish)
Will nature at a time be really lost,
no snowflake fall
as the world becomes extremely hot,
while big and small
live in a man-made kind of sheer hot hell?
If man kills all;
the fish, each bird, each animal and tree,
what's living will at a time, no more be.
No bird will sing, or even be flying,
tranquility
will be gone in a world as stark as stone,
each thing lovely,
each leaping fish, diving crying great eagle
will die slowly,
when all of the ozone layer is gone
and the greenhouse effect just lingers on.

Wolf Cento 

Very quick. Very intense, like a wolf
at a live heart, the sun breaks down.
What is important is to avoid
the time allotted for disavowels
as the livid wound
leaves a trace      leaves an abscess
takes its contraction for those clouds
that dip thunder & vanish
like rose leaves in closed jars.
Age approaches, slowly. But it cannot
crystal bone into thin air.
The small hours open their wounds for me.
This is a woman's confession:
I keep this wolf because the wilderness gave it to me.

Cinquain Twin In Free Verse 

Desire
Lips sealed with a kiss
Lips parted for more
Don't you know my love
Desire for ever more
The saga of ancient lore

I am the Eve of your Garden
Defamed by fate's cruel hand
I bore you in me as a thought beautiful
Carry the energy per your command
I am but the executrix of your deeds.

Cinquain Worry 

Worry
Shortens life-span,
And cuts the thread of life
Prematurely, abruptly,
On earth.
In life,
Stop worrying then,
Ere it seizes your heart,
And wrecks your mind and soul
In stealth.

Clerihew For Me And You 

A schoolboy called Edmund Clerihew
Bentley, as known to a very few
Lovers of English, began a century ago the fad of biography
In four lines and two rhymes, a sort of verse photography.
If asked why we ignore the surname Bentley,
I would reply ignorantly or innocently,
That what young Edmund innovated was levity
In finding rhymes to fit the four-line brevity.
- - - - - - -   October 2015,
Written when I remembered the popular verse:
John Stuart Mill,
By a mighty effort of will,
Overcame his natural bonhomie
And wrote â€˜Principles of Political Economyâ€™.

A Conceit Love 

The wings of desire
Mock the azure day-sky
Choosing forged feathers, wrought in celestrial fire
To kiss stars when given it's kiss to fly
Shining down a height which knows no higher
Overwhelming spirits, which within hearts lie
and when, if ever, this light comes to tire
The wistfulness of heaven's caresses soon die
Until falls dusk to the nights highest buyer
Where hearts burn deep and high
and the burning overwhelms, consumes desire
Fearing it's death, inbetween, it's own sweet sighs

A Conceit 

The Grey-beard Winter sat alone and still,
Locking his treasures in the flinty earth;
And like a miser comfortless and chill,
Frown'd upon pleasure and rejected mirth;
But Spring came, gentle Spring, the young, the fair,
And with her smiles subdued his frosty heart,
So that for very joy to see her there,
His soul, relenting, play'd the lover's part;
And nought could bring too lovely or too sweet,
To lavish on the bright Evangel's head;
No flowers too radiant for her tender feet;
No joys too blissful o'er her life to shed.
And thus the land became a Paradise,
A new-made Eden, redolent of joy,
Where beauty blossom'd under sunny skies,
And peaceful pleasure reign'd without alloy.

jottings on duvets and blizzards and the page
unwalked across               black missives of girlhood
must be sent off and do not claim the furnace
of the universe is powered by human screams.
When the dark turns dark
or when the bullet lifts a scalp,
it is enough to know the lover feels the slap
that the world can hear the sharp shout
which wakes the cat
her claws one inch from the rabbit's bobbing scut.

As bespoke by sanguine, yet ironically, you stumble amidst a thicker mist than most,
Dessicated and diseased, you hunch as a spider: stealing, binding, and defiling experiences never meant for you........

Flashback of witch's trials,
I hear the screams of Satan's child,
While searching for this mangled breed,
I have learned that death runs wild.
Chaos, death, pain, and blood,
Witnessing sanctuary rotting away,
Trapped, enslaved to this satanic flood,
I watch as the meaning of life turns gray.
I walk on the ground deceased,
The soul of death now shatters peace,
My souls is dead, I can't retreat,
I live yet die in conceit.
My thoughts of death, my rights concealed,
The suicide of dead soul thinking,
The sÃ©ance of my lost soul revealed,
The blood bath of twisted minds I am drinking!

Conceit 

Conceit looks at self in magnified ways,
Imagined superiority over nothing.
Arrogant and vain, its reason in disarray
Stands on a pedestal but is shaking.
Empty containers make a lot of noise,
Like heads full of air that produce an echo.
Brains are dull and make the wrong choice,
Fed by drugs and by stuff we all know.
A tree is thus known by the fruit.
It is never assessed by the color.
What deeds a man does is the truth,
Who he is - that's the fact he can't alter.

Conceit 

It is conceit that kills us
and makes us cowards instead of gods.
Under the great Command: Know thy self, and that thou art mortal!
we have become fatally self-conscious, fatally self-important, fatally entangled in the LaocoÃ¶n coils of our conceit.
Now we have to admit we can't know ourselves, we can only know about ourselves.
And I am not interested to know about myself any more,
I only entangle myself in the knowing.
Now let me be myself,
now let me be myself, and flicker forth,
now let me be myself, in the being, one of the gods.

Conceit 

Conceit,
And the explicit unconsciousness of it.
Is not noticed by those seeking adulation.
They are on the scene,
To ensure others are aware of their presence.
And if a bullhorn used is not effective...
Methods to gain attention by insults expressed,
Is the only way they can leave long lasting impressions.
Even though nothing else is left addressed.
Like something valued with substance to profess.
But nothing from their lips,
Probes below a shallowness to expose that kind of 'depth'.

Conceit 

She spun a line. She knew he was listening to her.
She spun it and he took the fraying ends.
Whatever she was saying, it was cotton,
Then as he rolled the thread between
Forefinger and thumb it turned to silk,
And as he took the needle up to thread it
The line she spun became thin finest gold.
He knew not to believe her but he took it
Because she kept on spinning like the truth
Was ravelling from her lips; he watched her lips.
Cotton, silk and gold, she wanted him
To take the line and sew the wound right up
Although she held the blade still in her hand
Behind her back, and it was dripping, steaming.
There under his left arm the gash lay open
Like a mouth in disbelief. And he believed her.

Mr Conceit 

He looks so proud with his younger woman walking hand in hand on the street
The macho bloke with the big ego the one known as Mr Conceit
In his mid to his latter fifties his muscles through his tightly fitting shirt bulging out
Broad shouldered he talks rather loudly like a rooster he does strut about.
His woman in her late twenties with brown hair and attractive and to him quite attracted 'twould seem
To be seen out with one young enough to be his daughter is good for his sense of self esteem
And in self esteem he's not lacking about him there is nothing shy
Why older blokes with big egos get younger women about that I do wonder why?
A solidly built greying fellow though not attractive to behold
His grand-daughter in kindergarden she has recently turned five years old
He left his ageing wife to be with the younger woman in her prime a blond local Rose
But as they age women lose their beauty such is life one would have to suppose.
When he's out with his younger woman they stroll on the street hand in hand
That she's an extension of his big ego is not that hard to understand
For egotistical males would not know how to be humble and none more egotistical than he
For he is one by his body language who says you should be looking at me.

Oh you with so much self conceit you mistake those with humility

At your own self promotion you surely do okay
Though empty vessels do make the most noise a wise one once did say.
Oh you so full of ego of you it can be said
That just a little success has gone straight to your head
Than you there are many greater though you don't see it that way
You will not go down in history as the greatest of your day.

Oil And Conceit 

Oil and the conceit
I remember a country called Norway
it was not a rich country, but it was socially fair
and had employment for most people and those
who were not employed had a benefit
that kept them afloat until a job came along.
Then oil came along it was a curse the biggest
merchant fleet in the world was flagged out.
The social cohesion tore the rich became richer
the poor left behind in the wake of the disappearing
A fleet of ships. And slowly almost unseen
the NHS service was replaced with private hospitals
and worst of all the people became arrogant
tried to stop migrants they wanted the wealth for
themselves and didn`t see the country was falling
into chasm self-importance, it was not a becoming
sight, luckily, a bit late in the day, people understand
what they have lost, and there are forces who
tries to rein in excess and bring the ship into the right course

Of the things in life that does make them feel proud
Pride of your country and your national flag
To many these are quite a common brag
Proud of your children and proud of your wife
And proud of your many successes in life
So many others do love to impress

Self Conceit And Self Love 

Self conceit and self love are a different thing
The self conceited expect others their praises to sing
But those who love themselves love other people too
Herein lay the big difference between the two
Self conceited people are of narcisstic kind
Any excuse for to talk of themselves they will find
But self love quite different to conceit very different indeed
For to be a good person self love you do need
As different 'twould seem as a weed to a rose
Just one way to describe them one would have to suppose
Self conceited people of their own lives only wish to hear
That themselves only matter seems obviously clear
But those who love themselves to others love can give
And without self adulation they gladly can live.

The Former Rose Of Cullen Free Of Conceit And Guile 

Her shoulder length wavy  hair was chestnut brown her eyes blue as the sky
On a clear and sunny day in Summer in the warmth of July
From her Duhallow Village she traveled far away
The former Rose of Cullen where might she be today?
Did she marry bear and raise children or as childless and single did she stay
And does she use anti aging creams and hair dyes for to cover time's decay?
As many aging women do in their battle against time
For beauty it is quick to fade in women past their prime
The former Rose of Cullen in her prime was lovely to behold
She would now be in her early seventies one could say getting old
In my memory she remains young and i picture her again
Walking hatless in the Village her brown hair blowing in the wind and rain
She left her Duhallow Village to live in the U S A
When the hawthorns of the hedgerows wore their white blooms of the May
The former Rose of Cullen free of conceit and guile
A beautiful young woman she did have a lovely smile.

Loves Logiccouplet Sonnet 

The more ways I find to express my love,
The more I love you, and the better for love,
And more: What more than seek such ways to it;
Expressing love (and therefore to do it) .
And if my love should make me false I would,
For better no false-love than mere falsehood.
How then is love (which others call)   more proved
Than mine is? And not merely false-love's truth?
Where love's logic meets between false or not
No arguments have heard but have forgot
That love is truth - and none is love more false
Than proof; So this I swear on life and pulse:
That infinite love's true call expresses
Love is something more than proof professes.

When unfortunate is the fate,
The many join and share the plate.

Dear Dactyl Of Adoration 

I'll say them every day you know.
Those three well-known monosyllables...
When I'm curled up to your contours in the carriage of a train,
When I wake and I sense you before I've opened my eyes,
When we're staring skywards a long way from home and mapping the stars,
When we're carefree and tossing pebble after pebble into the dusk-dressed sea,
When you're lost to your music, and don't hear my words,
When you finally sleep here and can rest in the calm...
Those three well-known, well-used, but well-loved monosyllables,
Which now mean much more than they have done before.

Hope Decastich 

We live in a world where war, disasters and destruction
are continually harassing us as if destiny is pursuing us,
as if everything in this world is out of control,
as if the portals of hell are standing wide open
and sometimes we become ill without any chance of being healed
and sometimes we loose loved ones to death
and it feels as if we are living on the edge of the abyss
but still the hope remains that life will become better,
that deliverance will come with the new tomorrow
as if a happier future is only waiting on us.

under the people that were elected to lead the way
and about their desire for fortune and fame,
about Presidents that do not waver to tell a lie,
about leaders that sent soldiers off to war
and wondered if they do consider the consequences
or is there something evil that besets each great good man
a corruption that power does always bring?

A Dirge For A Righteous Kitten 

To be intoned, all but the two italicized lines, which are to be spoken in a snappy, matter-of-fact way.
Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong.
Here lies a kitten good, who kept
A kitten's proper place.
He stole no pantry eatables,
Nor scratched the baby's face.
He let the alley-cats alone.
He had no yowling vice.
His shirt was always laundried well,
He freed the house of mice.
Until his death he had not caused
His little mistress tears,
He wore his ribbon prettily,
He washed behind his ears.
Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong.

With the treasures of lost happiness,
Wind sings a dirge for transience.

No more will we stumble and fall
On the sand at Portobello beach
Rolling in laughter
In love and in happiness.
No more will we stumble and fall
By the canal and the bushes
That May in Amsterdam
In fun and bliss.
No more will we stumble and fall
Reckless into each others hearts
As the bed fell apart
And we crashed and slept in chaos!
No more will we stumble and fall
Drunk in the winter snow
Wild and free as the wind
When Joy and Love were new.
No more shall we stumble and fall
Where all defenses are broken
Where love rushes in like the tide
When your eyes were my heaven

Walk Straight, walk Upright, always
And when the going is tough, have patience
Don't flatter, don't rattle, by dispraise
Life will test you with, every relation.
You will be guided by your passion,
So follow your dreams, until you reach the destination.
A thousand failures, should not distract you
Away from your set goals in life
Be courageous and remain tough like few
You will earn therespect of others, despite
Death will embrace you with pride
Your life story will inspire others and guide.

A Dirge 

Why were you born when the snow was falling?
You should have come to the cuckoo's calling
Or when grapes are green in the cluster,
Or, at least, when lithe swallows muster
For their far off flying
From summer dying.
Why did you die when the lambs were cropping?
You should have died at the apples' dropping,
When the grasshopper comes to trouble,
And the wheat-fields are sodden stubble,
And all winds go sighing
For sweet things dying.

A Dirge 

LET Summer go
To other gardens; here we have no need of her.
She smiles and beckons, but we take no heed of her,
Who love not Summer, but bare boughs and snow,
Set the snow free
To choke the insolent triumph of the year,
With birds that sing as though he still were here,
And flowers that blow as if he still could see.
Let the rose die--
What ailed the rose to blow? she is not dear to us,
Nor all the summer pageant that draws near to us;
Let it be over soon, let it go by!
Let winter come,
With the wild mourning of the wind-tossed boughs
To drown the stillness of the empty house
To which no more the little feet come home.

Call unto his funeral dole

To rear him hillocks that shall keep him warm,
And (when gay tombs are robb'd) sustain no harm;
But keep the wolf far thence, that 's foe to men,
For with his nails he'll dig them up again.

A Dirge Villanelle 

My heart keeps drinking shadows of the moon;
I've drowned before in darkness when it's bright;
My eyes keep spinning silence with a spoon
For silent strands to weave a dark cocoon,
Once blinded by the sweetness of the light.
My heart keeps drinking shadows of the moon
While crying tearless tears of a monsoon,
I'm choking on the shapelessness of night.
My eyes keep spinning silence with a spoon,
Your voice no longer readily in tune,
Released from pain its bitter mortal plight;
My heart keeps drinking shadows of the moon.
Your face a brightly piercing wild harpoon
Would leave me as a guardian with no sight;
My eyes keep spinning silence with a spoon
Believing it will one day be immune;
Until the light and darkness can unite,
My heart keeps drinking shadows of the moon;
My eyes keep spinning silence with a spoon.

Aprils Dirge 

Another reminder of a life once lived
Landmarks, a bond for some to share
Painful precursor three days up, seized
And death though aware
Nevertheless stood aghast
From the mouths of two in garments shining
Why seek ye among the dead the living?
He is risen, he is risen, he is risen
There, my hope for the hereafter
So on earth alive, I carry my hurts, my pains
But in a while they shall all abstain
And death shall stand aghast
For just bones, in my grave remain
Yonder, my spirit free at last
I rose, I rose, I rose

A Sea Dirge 

A Sea Dirge
I once saw, where the horizon ends,
a ship ploughed the sky.
White tears on pale blue,
I saw the waiting darkness;
I knew, before any others,
it would be a starlit night.
Look, I said, but it was too late,
the ship had cast anchor
behind a cloud loading mist
for Dogger Banks,
and take onboard discarded dreams to plug
the dikes of Amsterdam.
Sunflowers on mythical sea
and red flying fish,
my ship is bound for the Saragossa Sea with
cargo of old sailors,
here they come to stalk in fog of the forgotten.

Dirge For A Joker 

Always in the middle of a kiss
Came the profane stimulus to cough;
Always from teh pulpit during service
Leaned the devil prompting you to laugh.
Behind mock-ceremony of your grief
Lurked the burlesque instinct of the ham;
You never altered your amused belief
That life was a mere monumental sham.
From the comic accident of birth
To the final grotesque joke of death
Your malady of sacrilegious mirth
Spread gay contagion with each clever breath.
Now you must play the straight man for a term
And tolerate the humor of the worm.

Dirge For Blue Rose 

Blue Rose, yesterday you bloomed in my garden
Spreading scants and charms
I was so happy smelling scants, enjoying charms
But after two days you got pale and dark;
Blue Rose, I showed you all
Introduced as my queen in not garden but heart
A part of it
But now I am afraid and sad;
You are passing away soon
To me it has been fully and clearly known
Oh! My unfortunate, poor heart
Once you were really great.

Dirge For Darfur 

The wind,
Strums the strings,
Of the trees,
Tortured, distorted harps,
Their notes float gently into the mute night.
No sound, no sound...
No children's gentle breathings,
No tender lovers' murmurings,
No men and women talking, laughing...
Only the bowed trees
As the invisible Harpist
Plucks the dark, bent branches,
The notes sob in the blackness,
And tremble in the silence,
Their moans echo in the shivering stars.
Wind cupped, weeping, bitter
Notes, that ask, why does evil stand tall,
Why do the good lay fallen...

Slipping

Dirge In Woods 

A wind sways the pines,
And below
Not a breath of wild air;
Still as the mosses that glow
On the flooring and over the lines
Of the roots here and there.
The pine-tree drops its dead;
They are quiet, as under the sea.
Overhead, overhead
Rushes life in a race,
As the clouds the clouds chase;
And we go,
And we drop like the fruits of the tree,
Even we,
Even so.

Dirge Of Nelson 

Toll Nelson's knell! a soul more brave
Ne'er triumphed on the green-sea wave!
Sad o'er the hero's honoured grave,
Toll Nelson's knell!
The ball of Death unerring flew;
His cheek has lost its ardent hue;
He sinks, amid his gallant crew!
Toll Nelson's knell!
Yet lift, brave chief, thy dying eyes;
Hark! loud huzzas around thee rise;
Aloft the flag of conquest flies!
The day is won!
The day is won--peace to the brave!
But whilst the joyous streamers wave,
We'll think upon the victor's grave!
Peace to the brave!

Dirge Of The Three Queens 

URNS and odours bring away!
Vapours, sighs, darken the day!
Our dole more deadly looks than dying;
Balms and gums and heavy cheers,
Sacred vials fill'd with tears,
And clamours through the wild air flying!
Come, all sad and solemn shows,
That are quick-eyed Pleasure's foes!
We convent naught else but woes.

Boys and girls that held her dear,
Do your weeping now;
All you loved of her lies here.
Brought to earth the arrogant brow,
And the withering tongue
Chastened; do your weeping now.

Wind whatever wreath,
For a playmate perished young,
For a spirit spent in death.

Prayer unsaid, and mass unsung, Deadman's dirge must still be rung:

Wash him bloodless, smooth him fair, Stretch his limbs, and sleek his hair
Dingle-dong, the dead-bells go! Mermen swing them to and fro!
In the wormless sand shall he Feast for no foul glutton be:
Dingle-dong, the dead-bells chime! Mermen keep the tone and time!
We must with a tombstone brave Shut the shark out from his grave

Dirge 

We drop our dead in the sea,
The bottomless, bottomless sea;
Each bubble a hollow sigh,
As it sinks forever and aye.
We drop our dead in the sea,--
The dead reek not of aught;
We drop our dead in the sea,--
The sea ne'er gives it a thought.
Sink, sink, oh corpse, still sink,
Far down in the bottomless sea,
Where the unknown forms do prowl,
Down, down in the bottomless sea.
'Tis night above, and night all round,
And night will it be with thee;
As thou sinkest, and sinkest for aye,
Deeper down in the bottomless sea.

Dirge 

Darkness descended at noon
Rain fell after it vowed never to fall again
Is there still honey in the hive?
Will we further see the epiphyte glued to the palm?
The largest star within the galaxy has dropped!
I am soaked amidst my own tears right now
Hard-hearted, strong-boned that I am
Tears flow like the river in my eyes
We sob even in our heart
The heavens themselves open their doors
And pour down fresh water
To assuage the drought that plague us
As the saint ceases to breathe
He looks as fresh as bitterleaf
Like a newly sprouted bitterleaf
Rich in life
But richer in death.

COME away, come away, death,
And in sad cypres let me be laid;
Fly away, fly away, breath;
I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
O prepare it!
My part of death, no one so true
Did share it.
Not a flower, not a flower sweet,
On my black coffin let there be strown;
Not a friend, not a friend greet
My poor corse, where my bones shall be thrown:
A thousand thousand sighs to save,
Lay me, O, where
Sad true lover never find my grave
To weep there!

Dirge Without Music 

I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.
So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:
Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned
With lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.
Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.
Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.
A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,
A formula, a phrase remains,â€”but the best is lost.
The answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the
love,â€”
They are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled
Is the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not
approve.
More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the
world.
Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave
Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;
Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.
I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.

To touch the edge of infinity.

Etymological Dirge 

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear.
Calm comes from burning.
Tall comes from fast.
Comely doesn't come from come.
Person comes from mask.
The kin of charity is whore,
the root of charity is dear.
Incentive has its source in song
and winning in the sufferer.
Afford yourself what you can carry out.

We get our ugliness from fear.
We get our danger from the lord.

My Dirge 

Itâ€™s like there is no innocent heart
Neither before nor to be created later
With the crowded rigmarole
It is just squander goal
For endless adoration
People create demarcation
It obviously is internecine
A disease without medicine
Harmless hearts with true soul mates
Rarely available in few sites
So where it could be available
The close connection which is not terrible?
Having a wonderful soul mate
It either was my chance or my fate
But I can see itâ€™s true
Losing my soul mate is due

Ni Chans Dirge For Yen Oey 

SO soon asleep! Now must the coming years
Weep ignorantly their loss they cannot know,
And life miss ever what has never been
We weep to-day, let theirs be sadder tears
Who have not seen thee near as we have seen,
Who shall but learn a hope died long ago.
Alas for flowers untimely winds have broken,
That should have scattered seed of following flowers!
Alas for ruin of unbuilded towers!
Alas for ripening words that die unspoken!
But let them weep with sadder tears than ours
Who shall but learn a hope died long ago,
A world's hope long ago.

Sapphos Dirge 

Looking at the Pleiades
Poetess Sappho sheds tears
Do the Pleiades ever know
That a friend here is waiting for them
Magic and marvel fill the green isles
That throb like the rosary of the sea
The spark, the dream, and the sea-speak:
Surging and surfing over the waves of Time
Fighting and fighting, the men are in ruins
Still they are beating the war-drums again
Divorced and distempered the women in huts
Are distressed without enough drinking water
They shout there is no place at home
For those who do not return to work at home
We shall never clear their debts
We stand only for ourselves hereafter
Watching the Pleiades
Sappho sings her tears
To listen to the dirge of long waiting
The Pleiades come down

IF thou wilt ease thine heart

Hang any tear on your eye-lashes;
Lie still and deep,
Sad soul, until the sea-wave washes
The rim oâ€™ the sun to-morrow,
In eastern sky.
But wilt thou cure thine heart
Of love and all its smart,
Then die, dear, die;

With folded eye;
And then alone, amid the beaming
Of loveâ€™s stars, thou â€™lt meet her

Sonnet Dirge Or Anthem 

The String of Life when God cuts premature,
For Bards young who had burnt their midnight-oil,
Angered I feel at Godâ€™s cruel nature,
Is this His earthly reward for their toil?
Hit by disease and utter poverty,
In vain theyâ€™d struggled for mere existence;
Deserving though neâ€™er came prosperity;
They were given the earthly death-sentence!
Why hast Thou been God, so cruel to them?
If only they were allowed to live long,
My Dirge should have been turned into Anthem;
This would have become my most joyous song.
But wait, perhaps thou didst do what was best;
Rebuke God not; He gives at times men test!

She came, she's gone forever; our prettiest daughter
Our sweetest child couldn't live longer
The atmospheric earth didn't allow her in birth
Clutched her pneumonic bar with polluted air at birthing mirth
Three days with three nights she's lived in lungs jar
None we can touched, just observed from far even her mother
For fluctuation of blood we're sadden always in fear
Test after test as the advice of doctor fired on our anxious hearth
Although she came, she's gone forever
As long as she lived we're in praying within fear as believer
To get back her healthy spent time in altruistic deeds all family member
Dawn to dusk all through night it seemed she's flirted love
In beseeching doctor we're shocked with broken heart
In haggard night she left us lonely to the world of another
Although she came, she's gone forever

Wisdom Of Unseen Treasure Dirge 

The ageless passing of the wisdom
Lies beneath your feet and yet you keep on walking
In search of knowledge, information and truth
Wake up and break this unbroken chain
Leave your sense behind and walk the walk.
The very essence to get organized is killing you
Do the things you want to do without talking
The thing you call rationalize does not exist
It is the argument of the mind with the soul
Don't make your life a file of activities
Things won't change unless you change
Don't let your Grades define your future course
Crossing the roads and wondering where to head
The sea will never be calm and without the tides
The intimidating minds will shell out the intelligence
Beware of the facts, it's going to reveal without justice

DEAD, my beloved! This small purple weed
That grows upon thy grave shall have its time
To ripen and to wane, to bloom and seed;
But thou, strong doer, mightst not wait thy deed,
But thou, oh noblest, mightst not wait thy meed:
Dead in thy prime!
Gone, my beloved! I that held thine hand
Left sudden in a joyless waste alone!
I tossing on life's sea, and thou to stand
Hidden in the shadows of the silent strand.
Thou seeing me from where I may not land!
Gone from me, gone!
Sleep well: but what for me who still must wake?
Dream joys: but what for me who can but weep?
Oh darkened days where never dawn shall break!
Oh weary troth-plight I with sorrow make!
But thou, rest peaceful; care not for my sake.
Dear, sleep thy sleep.

Beauty In Silence Dizain 

I've always thought there's beauty in silence,
Restful calm in the quietness of dawn,
Moon shining bright in its magnificence
As the night dances the fleeting hours on.
The soundless masterpiece in time is done,
Notes and images I watched in my mind.
The essence of mute shadows so defined,
Lost in reverie, an audience of one.
Silence has my being there so confined-
What can soothe the soul, only Silence can.

As scouts leading the way along its route
Heralding the passage of the lord of day
See each dawn the Angels make their salute
Welcoming the Golden One passing by.

The light-heeled numbers laughing go,
Retreat, return, and ere they flee,
One moment pause in panting row,
And seem to say--Vos plaudite!

Goodbyes are just life exits made to be
Unlocked when time dictates a self-release.
For some do pain and drain exceedingly,
No sadness cloaks Goodbye, it dons on peace.
One takes back life when ties that burden cease,
Like birds set free fly through an open door.
They reveal there's a reason to live for.
Unchained of all the dreadful wounds and hurt,
Goodbye's the wind that blows and makes one soar,
Goodbye's the rainbow embracing one's worth.

A Doggerel Day 

The raindrops on the rooftop pitter patter
And the wind the leaves on the verandah scatter
On this wild and wet January sunday in the Summer
The type of day the Aussies call a 'bummer'
Today lovers not out walking hand in hand together
One might say this is doggerel writing weather
For to scribble useless rhymes in moments of leisure
Not for wealth or fame but for one's own pleasure.
Just like our image in the mirror is reflected
It has been said by weather our mood is affected
But I for one don't see cause for complaining
And I feel happy even though it's raining
The neighbour and his wife are shouting at each other
She screams at him I will go home to mother
Yesterday in the sunshine they walked hand in hand together
Perhaps their crankiness due to the weather?
A doggerel day for the old doggerel writer
And in the house across the street now all seems quieter
And tomorrow of love they will be only talking
Whilst hand in hand out in the sunshine walking.

I have penned one might say a lot of rhyme though i do not write that well
I am just one of the ordinary a man of doggerel
Yet penning rhymes on different things brings lots of joy to me
And to rhyme to me is easy as easy as can be
The years on me begin to show my better years long gone
But i am happy when i am rhyming and i will keep rhyming on
I hoped i might become a poet but that is going back in time
Perhaps three decades or more ago when i was in my prime
That was in my daydreaming days but daydreams seldom come true
And from life i am one who receive what only is my due
That poets are few and far between is surely not a lie
And i will be a rhymer until the day i die
Though i will never be a poet i have come to realize
Perhaps i will keep rhyming on until my last sunrise.

Havenâ€™t much time
Iâ€™ll get straight to the point.
Poetry tells
not of me and whatâ€™s mine.
Does the tale shake the dog,
can the tale make a rhyme?
If you think that thatâ€™s true
youâ€™re barking up the wrong tree.
The poetry tells of that which is true
all the wonderful truths
that lie inside you.
â€˜Tis the dog wags the tale
and when this is true
we have all the beauty
thatâ€™s living in you.

Dialysis! denominators do dearly denounce despotic devout!
Demystify these dense desperate desultory designations
Detoxify its deadly, doctrinal diph-theric dispersion

I wandered by a shop's bright window
I saw a person I think I know
It was me, in the reflection clear
What a clever person it did show.
The shopkeeper did see me leer,
As I adored my image there
Reflecting like a modern bard
He must have marvelled to see me here.
My sciatica began to ache
So it was time for me a move to make
I shuffled by like a gimp with a limp
To leave admirers in my wake.
With my inheritance, no need to work
So I shared my gifts, no time to shirk
Mine was such a prestigious lurk
Very few knew, I was a jerk

Though to my reputation as a writer it has come at a cost
I feel grateful to doggerel without it I would feel lost
Though the stuff I pen won't outlive me failed by the test of time

For many years and Seasons I have been a rhyme buff
And I have written one might say a lot of rhyming stuff
But anybody can pen rhyme 'tis easy as can be
Like bill does always rhyme with hill and bee does rhyme with tree,
No two do look at life the same that's how it does seem to me
Through our different eyes as the wise one said a different World we see
Suppose we would be boring if we all thought in the same way
Our different views on life makes  us interesting as some are known to say

I Know Every Doggerel I Do Pen 

I know every doggerel I do pen is one doggerel nearer to my last
And I know the years on me are telling that my better days are in the past
But why worry for what never can be and why pine for what has long gone
The love of life is what should matter and the will to keep on keeping on
I know life for many is not easy and many far worse off than me
And that fifty per cent of the human population are living in dire poverty
I feel in life I have been lucky that lady luck is on my side
Circumstances of birth not against me and to a fair go I've never been denied,
For millions life is their great battle of hope they do live in despair
They will live and they will die as the have nots of the bigger World out there
One must pity the poor and forgotten though they need more than sympathy
Though all people supposed to be equal in a World of inequality
But the Reaper makes everyone equal since to his scythe everyone does fall
So why not drink a toast to the Reaper and a toast to a fair go for all.

I write a lot though not that well
With rhyming words one who loves to play
I do write new rhymes every day
For many years a rhyming buff
I do write reams of rhyming stuff
I did love reading rhymes as a boy
And writing them i now enjoy
Unworthy of the title of poet
Or to be seen as one worthy of literary note
But the rhyming bug is with me to stay
It is each to their own as the wise one say
In life everybody of some hobby are in need
But how boring we would be indeed
If in our pursuit of wealth and fame
We all in our ways were the same
In my late twenties i penned my first rhyme
Of years this is going back in time
One who has written much but not that well
I will die as a man of doggerel.

Though if poets are few poetasters not hard to find
It is easy so easy for one to pen rhyme
But only a poem does stand the test of time
Though your worth as a writer yourself you may doubt
There is always so much for one to write about
And if you enjoy writing as much as i do it is not a waste of time

There are no shortage of things for to write rhymes about
The fourth day of March in the calendar Fall
But it does not feel that much like Autumn at all
It seems like a warm day in Summer with just a slight breeze
On a weather temperature high for the day of close to thirty degrees
In the mostly blue sky just a few clouds of gray
In the shade of the trees the cattle chewing their cuds lay
Among the rank grass the color of hay
Not good for cattle weight gain would seem true to say
With the sun on their dark wings chirping as they fly
Welcome swallows chasing flying insects across the sky
And with so little time to mate, lay eggs and breed
The cabbage white butterflies flit above the mustard weed
Such beautiful weather for the time of year
The warbling of the magpies are pleasant to hear
And in a familiar voice to many and familiar to me
The black and white magpie larks singing pee wee.

Rhymed Poetry Or Doggerel 

I aimed for some things, but
thatâ€™s not what I got;
I aimed for a better slot,
But I couldnâ€™t get what I ought.
When things fail, we blame our lot;
Success in life is a war well-fought;
Our focus must be on the dot;
At times, reputations can be bought.
Despite lifeâ€™s clime, rainy or hot,
We must do our duty, not rot;
Things happen our ways somewhat,
Or in strife and travail, we are caught!
Yet, never blame yourself for what youâ€™re not,
Nor sleep all life in a luxurious cot!
Because you are the Makerâ€™s beloved, a pot,
You must end up as a zealot.

The Daily Doggerel Reading Mary Oliver 

Every evening I try to read her
five poems by Mary Oliver
five poems - no more - no less.
They free me to be still
they help me to be quiet
I - for five poems - do not apologize
to the world for who I am
that I exist
that I write bad poetry.
They give me strength
with which I go after reading
and help clean the cat box.

Daughter safely an Oklahoma Indian reservation
Wife heating up hot shower pipes

What even my ailing body has denied
Write.
So to you dear Saint Helen
Patron saint of a poet out of favor
May the Great Other bless you

Wise medical counsel
Use of your first rate lap pool
For all these blessings bestowed

Thank You.

The Demon Of Doggerel 

The mantle of greatness I never will don
But the demon of doggerel urges me to write on
He is in my mind and is controlling me
And of his influence I will never be free.
He is in my mind and he is in my soul
And my very existence he seems to control
He compels me to pen doggerel every day
With him I can't ever give writing away.
Though writing of slipshod verse is not a crime
He urges me to pen more doggerel rhyme
Poetasters are anonymous in every town
And they never do know of literary renown.
Since by the demon of doggerel I have been possessed
I cannot say of talent that I have been blessed
Due to his influence I feel compelled to write
And to post more stuff in to the internet literary site.

The Goat That Cheated My First Doggerel 

I showed my goat how to play chess
she was quite good, was not the best.
She ate the board and made a mess
and failed the Goatly challenge test.
She ran amok in the judging tent.
Her rivals thought it was heaven sent!
Pawns and Bishops all got bent,
the Trophy? Twas just a little dent.
So, no more chess, I've thrown that out,
I could not handle the goatly pout.
So, over crisps, and a pint of stout,
We'll discuss the art of tickling trout.

The Love Of Penning Doggerel 

The love of penning doggerel in me does remain
Though for me in such there's no financial gain
I write for enjoyment that and nothing more
That's something you may have heard me say before
My best days in life to the forever gone
But for as long as i can i will keep rhyming on
Yes i will keep rhyming despite those who say
That i should give my literary ambitions away
For many years i have been a rhyming buff
I am one who has written a whole pile of stuff
And though writing does not bring me money or fame
It is something i do quite enjoy doing just the same
And for to give it away i do not have a plan
I just hope to keep doing it for as long as i can.

There Isn T Any Doggerel There 

There isn't any doggerel there this morning
The inspiration well in me is dry
I hear the sound of footsteps on the sidewalk
And silver gulls along the foreshore cry.
And on the silky oaks house sparrows chirping
For house sparrows don't have a song to sing
And magpie lark the black and white bird whistling
His pee wee notes have a familiar ring.
And through it all the noise of passing traffic
And gas and smog pollute suburban skies
And Humankind I feel is the big loser
Where voice of Nature compete with man created noise.
Of any inspiration i feel empty
I feel burnt out from scribbling doggerel
The poets are gone to join the poets of heaven
And i am bound for the poetasters hell.
On silky oak the plain house sparrows chirping
And magpie lark is whistling pee wee
And man created noise compete with Nature
And silver gulls are calling by the sea.

Those Who Define What Is Doggerel From Poetry 

Those who define what is doggerel from poetry in their own ways seem small
To them even a well written rhyme poem is not poetry at all
Are their souls without music is poetry not song
Or is my thinking outdated have I got it wrong?
What to them is or is not poetry is their business not mine
They have their opinions and that suits me fine
As for me one who can't separate blank verse from prose
Must be unenlightened one would have to suppose.
Yet I do not apologize for my liking of rhyme
And for my favourite poets I must go back in time
And perhaps I do seem old fashioned in my antiquated way
When I say I do not have a liking of the poems of the major poets of today.
Of one deceptive modernist terminology I have taken note
There is no such a thing as a doggerel poet
The point of music in rhyme they somehow seem to miss
But even amongst some of the highly educated ignorance can be bliss.

You Call It Stuff Or Doggerel 

You call it stuff or doggerel or call it what you may
I've written reams and reams of it and I've known a better day
I've got a penning addiction that would seem fair to say
But few of us near perfect or so 'twould seem that way.
When I look in the mirror an ageing bloke I see
And I never use the word poet when I'm describing me
And that is just being honest not false humility
Self praise seems rather boastful as many would agree.
I had my dreams of wealth and fame going back decades ago
But life's not a blooming garden as one like me should know
In life as I've discovered there's many an up and down
And I've done my share of living far south of my Hometown.
An ageing addictive rhymer just that and nothing more
Like the migratory birds on their Wintering grounds far from their Homeland shore
But unlike the migratory birds who go home to breed in Spring
I remain here on a distant shore and of the Homeland sing.
You can call it stuff or doggerel or what you so decide
and you may say I'm low in self esteem or one who lacks in pride
I've aged but I have not matured like well fermented wine
And what you think about me is your business not mine.

Arranged Marriages An Ekphrastic Poem 

O damn the conventional
Parents'arranged marriages!
I don't want to see his
Face. Nor does he mine
No feelings. Zilch
Our kiss, if you call a kiss
Is a parchment rubbing our lips
Our tongues suffocate
I block him. He blocks me
In frustration we suffer
Castrated, neutered we now both feel
And yet we both could not rebel
We are utter strangers
In a cornered nightmarish union
Love by prescription
A marriage made in hell
Imprisoned, oppressed
Our lives out sucked
In the dry sahara of love
Clad in shrouds we're dead.

To a fresh contemporary eye, appears a modern, secular man..strong in mind and body taut.

An Elegy In Frost 

Cold sunshine writes our elegy in frost,
Author of light a million snowflakes lost,
All gone forever into swirling air,
A dance of death that is no longer there.
Pure poetry becomes a stanza said,
Classical white a message left unread,
While we stand longing for a winter past,
Hurt by a mood that was too fey to last.
West is a shadow wrapped around frail bones,
Your hand in mine for eloquence atones.
Touch is a brevity that needs no sound
To turn the weather of the world around.

But a span as wide as Europe;

Or as the Spirits' Pathway lieth on the night.
And I heard a voice crying
This is the Path of Glory.

The flowers are now shattered
Their thorns bleed the rose
A Basket full of withered Daisies
Where the wild sunflower still grows;
'Tis a backfall of listless last days
Oh, the grey simply swallows you
Gone are the blistering days of Summer
As Autumns amber breaks in anew;
The shadows growing e'er longer
Gold and russet leaves fly away
Surounded by temporary graves for the Tulip
No where for the Meadow Lark to play;
The morn ' air carries its crispness
While the dew, too soon, becomes frost
Woeful cries stir from all of Nature
In mourning, for Summer Days, now lost;

Elegy Before Death 

There will be rose and rhododendron
When you are dead and under ground;
Still will be heard from white syringas
Heavy with bees, a sunny sound;
Still will the tamaracks be raining
After the rain has ceased, and still
Will there be robins in the stubble,
Brown sheep upon the warm green hill.
Spring will not ail nor autumn falter;
Nothing will know that you are gone,
Saving alone some sullen plough-land
None but yourself sets foot upon;
Saving the may-weed and the pig-weed
Nothing will know that you are dead,â€”
These, and perhaps a useless wagon
Standing beside some tumbled shed.
Oh, there will pass with your great passing
Little of beauty not your own,â€”
Only the light from common water,
Only the grace from simple stone!

Elegy For My Soul 

Deep down me,
Recedes a voice,
Gone with it's poise,
An echo of a knight,
A relentless warrior,
Fought peacfully on his will's behalf,
Thought gregariously to mend the world,
Feigned by the beauty,
Torn by the harsh reality,
Lost his eccentricity.
Oh! there recedes the voice,
Voice of the dumb,
Left with it's flesh and bone,
Borne to mourn,
Tears alone to drown the soul,
Receded the voice,
Dumped me heartless, painless,
To face the crooked world.

And bees and birds of England

They have their graves afar.
And they that rule in England,
In stately conclave met,
Alas, alas for England,
They have no graves as yet.

In the thin classroom, where your face

I find this boily creature in your place;
find you disarranged, squatting on the window sill,
irrefutably placed up there,
like a hunk of some big frog
watching us through the V
of your woolen legs.
Even so, I must admire your skill.
You are so gracefully insane.
We fidget in our plain chairs
and pretend to catalogue
our facts for your burly sorcery
or ignore your fat blind eyes
or the prince you ate yesterday
who was wise, wise, wise.

Since I lost you, my darling, the sky has come near,
And I am of it, the small sharp stars are quite near,
The white moon going among them like a white bird among snow-berries,
And the sound of her gently rustling in heaven like a bird I hear.
And I am willing to come to you now, my dear,
As a pigeon lets itself off from a cathedral dome
To be lost in the haze of the sky, I would like to come,
And be lost out of sight with you, and be gone like foam.
For I am tired, my dear, and if I could lift my feet,
My tenacious feet from off the dome of the earth
To fall like a breath within the breathing wind
Where you are lost, what rest, my love, what rest!

Elegy 

After the tears, heartfelt tears and crocodile tears,
I sit here with mouldy bread crumbs, dill leaves and salt.
The plastic clock above the fridge strikes the hour
to the sound of the same old quarrelling in the street,
echoes resound in the gutters like bits of truth
and madness still propels our globe like the first ache.
Weâ€™ve buried you the way you asked: with no stone
or wooden cross above your decaying forehead,
only the simple sky, the clouds, and the old sun.
And at night the moon and the stars will comfort you
more faithfully than any human ever could.
Sad grand poet, I wish I could find the right words,
but for the thousandth time the cold wind says it best,
and nothing is more eloquent than its goodbye.

Others by wills give legacies, but I
Dying, of you do beg a legacy.
My fortune and my will this custom break,
When we are senseless grown to make stones speak,
Though no stone tell thee what I was, yet thou
In my grave's inside seest what thou art now,
Yet thou 'rt not yet so good ; till death us lay
To ripe and mellow there, we're stubborn clay.
Parents make us earth, and souls dignify
Us to be glass ; here to grow gold we lie.
Whilst in our souls sin bred and pamper'd is,
Our souls become worm-eaten carcases.

Elegy V His Picture 

Here take my picture; though I bid farewell
Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell.
'Tis like me now, but I dead, 'twill be more
When we are shadows both, than 'twas before.
When weather-beaten I come back, my hand
Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun beams tann'd,
My face and breast of haircloth, and my head
With care's rash sudden storms being o'erspread,
My body'a sack of bones, broken within,
And powder's blue stains scatter'd on my skin;
If rival fools tax thee to'have lov'd a man
So foul and coarse as, oh, I may seem then,
This shall say what I was, and thou shalt say,
'Do his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay?
Or do they reach his judging mind, that he
Should now love less, what he did love to see?
That which in him was fair and delicate,
Was but the milk which in love's childish state
Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough
To feed on that, which to disus'd tastes seems tough.'

Fragment Of The Elegy On The Death Of Bion 

From the Greek of Moschus.
Ye Dorian woods and waves, lament aloud,--
Augment your tide, O streams, with fruitless tears,
For the beloved Bion is no more.
Let every tender herb and plant and flower,
From each dejected bud and drooping bloom,
Shed dews of liquid sorrow, and with breath
Of melancholy sweetness on the wind
Diffuse its languid love; let roses blush,
Anemones grow paler for the loss
Their dells have known; and thou, O hyacinth,
Utter thy legend now--yet more, dumb flower,
Than 'Ah! alas!'--thine is no common grief--
Bion the [sweetest singer] is no more.

4 Epic Chronicles Serial Killer 

Mercy is not a part of me, soul is burned, but thatâ€™s not how deep it gets
A killer in every sense of the word, maybe even a serial killer, I guess the shoes fit
I have left bodies drenched in blood, leaving you bleeding with your ancestors
Your family would never be at peace, like souls, victims of child molesters
In my mind, I fall eternally into the dark space where I dance with the devil
I am no angel who heals wounds by any means or with alcohol
Rather drain your body in bathroom stalls, I am sick not mentality there
Mentally ill I am not looking for remorse, just wish I had a life that was fair
Wish my life ended, or I was burned literally with a torch
But here on forth, I cleanse my dirty hands, wiped off the dry blood
Too late, picked up by police and I sung like a bird
Came to find I was only picked up because of a lot of bad tickets
The cameras of the media took lovely flicks of me getting handed life
Now I lay in this shallow bed, with killers like me and rapist reside
Couldnâ€™t take it inside, I slit my own atom apple out
World saved from this demonâ€¦I deserved it
Donâ€™t kill, especially if you donâ€™t have the nerves for it

Songs related to epic poems a pride

The talent shown by the herding men

Epic Eternal Ever On Unfold 

A great piece of verse seems this universe,
Lyrics emanating from quantum soup,
Each of whose word vibrates as it quivers,
Inter-linked, its lines make eternal loop.
Has a unique metre but blank of rhyme,
It's too subtle in human ken to sink,
The warps and woofs are made of space and time,
And every line's writ with vanishing ink.
An epic of immense proportions,
Its quaint imagery yon of man's reach,
Leaving one speechless its figure of speech,
And deeper delves its meaning than oceans.
In constant change, ever evolving mould,
An epic â€˜tis forever on unfold.

Epic Joureny 

Epic Journey
This story happened before the invention of snow-scooters,
a couple- the Ã˜sterjÃ¸en was frozen over- wanted to flee
the poverty of Suomi to the relative prosperous Svearike on
a sledge pulled by their pony. It was a long, cold treck, their
small horse got very tired and could not pull them anymore.
They needed the pony it could be used as carter of gods in
Stockholm. They made the tired animal lie down
on the sledge put a big blanket over it and continued their
journey. The winter night was very cold and they also got
too tired to pull the sledge. They lay down beside the horse
and slept snugly to a dazzling sunlight awoke them.
The pony rested was fed with the last sack of hay left and
harnessed. In good mood all three continued their heroic
crossing to Svearike and new future.

Epic Men 

Epic men of flesh and stone
Travel where are found no bones;
The deepest, where no man before
Could open hope's remaining door.
The men of constellation's fame
Borrowed time, their epic names,
To fight odd battles in the sky
That no one now remember why.
Still there's a corner, not forgot,
An alien, though homelike plot,
Where men of flesh and stone will lie
In state, the doomed spaceship's flight.
They'll rest forever on the cusp
Of magic finds, made in our trust,
So teach the young their names instead
Of ancient heroes, too long dead.

Epic Mother 

Kunti the great mother of Pandavas
The princes of Hastinapura
The great characters of Mahabharata
The great mother Kunti and her woes
Her tears for her beloved sons
Her dedication for her beloved ones
Her sadness and sympathy hid in mind
Of Karna the son whom she abandoned
Mother Kunti the great epic mother.

Epic Of Life18 

In spite of achievements no. one to him eluded
Being monopoly of the Creator and not of the created.
Intense was his striving for that coveted position,
For more research gave him further inspiration.
Wealth he treasured material and spiritual
Incomplete yet was though his sole ambition.
He wanted to creat life in ways artificial
To be victorious in his unique competition.
Gigantic will power and sustained hard work
Enables him to produce life in laboratory,
With process artificial but natural ingredients.
His march it endorsed towards that position.

Epic Of Life31 

Unpredictability of future is a spice of life,
It may even prove wrong 'as you sow, so you reap'.
Enormous endeavours to succeed may here be flop
Good deeds may be rewarded in place of joy by grief.
Man the social animal has to learn a lesson,
Fortune may not laugh at him with his permission.
Stopping its onslaught may be beyond his power,
Prepared he should be to be a defeated emperoor.
Happy he could be by welcome developments
Grief too he could feel by unwelcome incidents.
Balance of mind be maintained in both the events,
He should not forgo ever his own contentment.

Epic Of Life32 

Birth and death are the two permanent stations
Shuttles progeny of parmatma in between them.
Man is mortal but his soul immortal, says Hinduism.
The soul, it says, is Parmatma; s minutest division.
Modern science disciples may contradict the claim.
The theory of rebirth, they may say, is a sham.
Baseless n unscientific to it they may name.
Forgetting possible logic how they can ti it blame.
Biological process in birth they must consider.
New life-cycle starts due to mating of individuals.
Every new born inherits parts of its parents,
Rebirth it is partially pf it's fater and mother.

Epic Of Life33 

Chase of money, wealth and money power
Lands human being in grief and despair.
The greed for the duo is quite insatiable
To achieve contentment, he can not be able.
Chase of ultimate power too is quite dangerous
The journey for the same is too much perilous.
Near absolute power, may it be money or muscle
Creates optimum enemies ready to him jostle.
Extreme of anything is often disastrous,
The best possible policy suggested Confucious
For mortal beings to adopt path golden middle,
Best it is to eat sugar being an ant little.
Money and also muscle are nodoubt necessary
For every one living to over-come his worries.
Money as also muscle as well as good health
Are means of living n can not be end ultimate.

Epic Of Life3 

Scattered on an elevation are the Konkani huts
Adjoining the beach in an elegane resort,
With it's 'Tarang', the beach restaurant.
On a platter natural beauty the duo present.
The divine scenic beauty and its hypnotism
Spell bounds a spectator and pushes him in bosom
Of the mother nature n he enters a trance,
Sitting under umbrella facing ocean Arabian.
Blowing hot air on scorching summer noon
Humid atmosphere soaking in perspiration
Compell even the birds to find their shelter
Leaving solitary ocean with his tides to roar.
Solace could be found from sip through straw
When ambrosia from raw coconut you draw
That can make you in scorching summer calm
Standing beneath meager shadow of a palm.

Epic Of Life4 

Pleasanr breez is ushered in by the setting Sun
The monotony and scorching heat are now bygone.
The over-joyed tides too welcome the change
The warn-out life starts itself to rearrange.
Shocked by the sea and sea shores' magniyide
Overjoyed by the panorama and it's platitude
Tiny tots were building castles with sand
While augmenting sea shells treasure grand.
Inhaling the elixir abundant in the nature
They collected pebbles looking like sapphires.
Happier they were than most of millionaires
By possessing treasure collected on sea shore.
Marvelous inner sanctum of the divine abode,
An embodiment itself of unique magnificence
With it's blood red stones adroitly sculptured
Facing arabian sea it accepts its obeisance.
Lord Ganesha dwells there with pious belief
His devotees make a beeline to pay Him respects
To spill their agonies and all of their grief
Before the Lord, to seek from them respite.

Epic Of Life6 

Away from there in cities Mumbai Pune
Another ocean exists formed of humans.
It too has tides high and still higher
Of immigrants, never to recede, as in ocean.
Theory of objectivism propounded Ayn Rand
Break on exploitation of talent was her demand.
She had come down heavily on second raters
Who stole ideas from genius and were cheaters.
To socialists too she had taken to task
She mounted an attack for tearing their mask.
The clever suck the life blood of genius
They are selfish, inhuman said she, and vacuous.
Leaders cheat people in the name of altruism,
Only selfishness they nurture in their bosom.
Motley plans they devise for the development
With hidden agenda of self aggrandizement.
No doubt they help in development process
By throwing some morsels among the masses
Which too are gulped by their lieutenants
The common man is forced only to lament.

Epic Of The Yser 

Dead with his face to the foe!'
From Hastings to Yser
Our men have died so.
The lad is a heroâ€“
Great Canada's pride:
We sent him with glory,
For glory he diedâ€“
So ring out the church-bells! Float the flag high!
Then I heard at my elbow a fierce mother-cry.
On the desolate plain
Where the dark Yser flows
They'll bury him, maybe,
Our Child of the Snows:
The message we sent them
Through fire and through flood
He signed it and sealed it
To-day with his bloodâ€“
United we stand! Our Empire is One!
But this woman beside me? . . . The boy was her son.

Epic 

I have lived in important places, times
When great events were decided, who owned
That half a rood of rock, a no-man's land
Surrounded by our pitchfork-armed claims.
I heard the Duffys shouting "Damn your soul!"
And old McCabe stripped to the waist, seen
Step the plot defying blue cast-steel -
"Here is the march along these iron stones."
That was the year of the Munich bother. Which
Was more important? I inclined
To lose my faith in Ballyrush and Gortin
Till Homer's ghost came whispering to my mind.
He said: I made the Iliad from such
A local row. Gods make their own importance.

Epic Smile 

Time slows;
then stops.
You have an epic smile,
shining brightly to challenge the sun.
You laugh with your soul,
eyes sparkling in the light.
You have an epic smile,
one I will never forget.
My heart leaps at your voice,
a smile shattering the gloom of life.
You have an epic smile,
brighter than a thousand suns.
I will think of you often,
though truthfully I already do.
You have an epic smile, my muse,
one that will always be with me.

Epic Story Of Childhood 

Effulgence of childhood stories
The great stories in Indian epics
Stories of childhood of Sree Krishna

In the life of a cowherd and friends
As beloved son in an effluent family
The great loving mother and her punishment
As life of god incarnated and blessing

News Epic Of Demons Death 

To hear some news,
the village men gathered close around.
The town crier began and no one made the slightest sound.
'The dead men's bones where found bleaching,
beneath the noonday sun,
the stinging gnats and black flies,
swarming over every blessed one.
Black carrion birds
enjoyed a dreadful feast,
I would say
and the marauding killer beastie has gotten clean away.'

One Day Id Like To Write An Epic Poem 

One day I'd like to write an epic poem.
That could mirror the fragility of life
It would be as light as a butterfly's wing
And as sublime as a crimson sunset:
Radiating with the beauty of the Word,
And capturing all the sorrows of the world.
It would be as clear as purest crystal
Yet as elliptical as a distant star.
It would face the monstrous, raging darkness
With matador like skill and elegance.
Its great power would lie in its gentleness
And its sense of grace as soft as snow flakes.
In time it might slowly expand consciousness.
And I hope it would make the angels weep!
One day I'd like to write an epic poem
That could mirror the fragility of life.

The Epic Of My Love 

Death be dead no matter what! !
Wind be still no matter what,
For the epic of my love still hangs in the air;
Walking around in search of my lover.
Amicably noted are my works of peace and love! !
Nature and life,
Dutifully attached by the wind;
With the maticulous attention of my love to share with you,
Looking for her along the narrow path.
Life and love,
The shadow of things with the muse of my sweet mind!
Death be dead no matter what;
To entertain my mind with the works of the truth,
And, let the wind be still as well.

The heroic stars spending themselves,
Coining their very flesh into bullets for the lost battle,
They must burn out at length like used candles;
And Mother Night will weep in her triumph, taking home her heroes.

This magnificent raid at the heart of darkness, this lost battle-
We don't know enough, we'll never know.
Oh happy Homer, taking the stars and the Gods for granted.

Ullalim The Epic Of Love Of The Maducayan 

ULLALIM, THE EPIC OF LOVE OF THE MADUCAYAN
By Melvin Banggollay Jr.
An ullalim epic is a traditional music and poetry form of th
e Philippines. These are long chanted stories passed down f
or hundreds of years that tell the exploits of heroes. They
 are classics of the Malayo-Polynesian language family. The
 most skilled poets would memorize epic cycles that took tw
o to four days to recite during all-night dramatic performa
nces. Two examples of precolonial (before the Spanish came)
  epics that survive today are Biag ni Lam-ang (Legend of L
amang)  in Ilocano (a northern Luzon dialect)  and Ibalon i
n Bicol (a southern Luzon dialect) . The term ullalim is so
metimes used today to refer to that style of song, but the 
real ullalim is the epic poem of the Kalinga people. An art
icle I read says that the singer would dress up in brilliant, flashy clothes like the hero described in the story.
It is the  considered an epic of the kalinga people depictin
g the struggle of Banna and Lagunwa who were the main chara
cters of the love story  Ullalim-this is a long epic song o
f the Kalinga about the adventures of Banna, the hero of th
e epic. Tagalog Epic Story Maragtas  is the counterpart of 
the Ullalim Epic of the Kalinga people. Ullalim-this is a l
ong epic song of the Kalinga about the adventures of Banna,
 the hero of the epic, and his amorous relationship with La
ggunawa. The story tells us that Banna was a travelling adv
enturous man going from place to place in search for a maid
en to marry until one day he found Lagunnawa that truly mer
smerize him until they fall in love with each other. Laguna
wa was known as the most beautiful woman in the villages he
 went though while Banna was known to be a young, handsome 
and brave tribal leader with unmatched skill in hand to han
d with out without spear or bulo. He was feared by all men 
for having that lightning speed during combat but so sought
 by many woman with his sterling qualities and handsome looks and athletic feature.
One day, he came to a village and met Lagunawa that for the 
first time he felt  in love with this beautiful woman oozin
g with enchanting beauty of an angel. To get her, he serena
ded her with a song that started by giving a "moma" singing
 that if you like me oh woman of beauty so serene like the 
melody of the moon shining above, take my simple offering f
rom the bottom of my heart.  The woman on the other hand be
ing so in love with this man whom he behold so handsome and
 kind, accepted the moma and chewed it while singing, " oh 
you are the man of my dream that cherished every dreams I h
ave, come let me love thee with all the pearl of my heart. 
" Together, they dance and sung song full of burning passio
n until they decided to get married and form a union of the
ir waring villages to end the conflict between their villag
es. From such marriage, the villages live in peace and harm
ony and shared the spirit of love  Banna and Lagunawa have for the two village.
Every village have their own Ullalim depicting the struggle 
and journey of Banna in search for the woman of her heart, 
Lagunawa. Even the place of Maducayan, have such epic hande
d down from generations to generations depicting the strugg
le of a man in search for true love and passion.  Banna was
 believed to originate from Maducayan an old village in the
 hinterlands of the Mountainous areas of the Cordillera Reg
ion. Lagunnawa, on the other hand,  was believe to be from a village far away in the land of Kalinga.

Water An Epic Story 

Heroic names, holistic names they gave
To the great rivers every where
In Indian epic texts rivers widely revered
Gratitude and salutes they gave
Rivers played a vital role in human life
History made in the banks of rivers
Wars fought for water and rivers
Enemies came swimming across rivers
The rivers an inseparable thing to nature
Story of the great king Bhageeratha
Believed to have bought the river Ganges
From Heights of heaven he bought it
For the welfare of the great country India
Bhageeratha the King's name remembered
Bhageerathi the river ever called.
The great country blessed with rivers.

Women In Epic Character 

I remember the story of Maithrayi
The great scholar, and sage
In Indian tradition she educated
An active argumentative talented
Where she gained wisdom through knowledge
Where she gained acclaims for scholarship
The sanskrit language she conversed
She argued, debated, texts of knowledge
Thousands of years back the epic story
The modern world's inspiration requires
Where women's education, scholarship vital
In all spheres of life, occasion, administration
May a good tomorrow of world we aspire
Sound judgement from wisdom of knowledge
Sound heart the women carries in life
The great responsibility she takes
Every human being a child of women sometimes.

ADDRESSED TO THE GENTLEMEN REFLECTED ON IN THE ROSCIAD,
A POEM, BY THE AUTHOR
Worried with debts and past all hopes of bail,
His pen he prostitutes t' avoid a gaol.

LET not the 'hungry' Bavius' angry stroke
Awake resentment, or your rage provoke;
But pitying his distress, let virtue shine,
And giving each your bounty, 'let him dine';
For thus retain'd, as learned counsel can,
Each case, however bad, he'll new japan;
And by a quick transition, plainly show
'Twas no defect of yours, but 'pocket low',
That caused his 'putrid kennel' to o'erflow.

I'll tell you a plan for gaining wealth,
Better than banking, trade or leases â€”

Keeps your cash in your hands, where nothing can trouble it;
And every time that you fold it across,

Frank carves very ill, yet will palm all the meats;
He eats more than six, and drinks more than he eats.

And seasons his whiffs with impertinent jokes:

And my cruel unkindness compels him to speak,
For of late I invite him - but four times a week.

Though to thy soft dominion yield

Alas, alas! O Cardoness,

Epigram On A Ladys Lace Shown For A Favour 

As Nelly to a chamber got
To take her leave of Ned
She loosd her lace & Cast a knot
(Ah why unlacd the maid.).
Now pull the further end she cryd
The Youth obeyd commands
And still the knot ye faster tyd
The more they parted hands
This fancy by the lover seen
She gave the silken braid
And with a kiss or two between
The parting posy said
When this you see remember me
And love me more & more
This knot when you at distance drew
Came closer than before.

Epigram 

OH, be not led away,
Lured by the colour of the sun-rich day.
The gay romance of song
Unto the spirit life doth not belong:
Though far-between the hours
In which the Master of Angelic powers
Lightens the dusk within
The holy of holies, be it thine to win
Rare vistas of white light,
Half-parted lips through which the Infinite
Murmurs its ancient story,
Hearkening to whom the wandering planets hoary
Waken primeval fires,
With deeper rapture in celestial choirs
Breathe, and with fleeter motion
Wheel in their orbits through the surgeless ocean.
So hearken thou like these,
Intent on it, mounting by slow degrees,
Until thy songâ€™s elation
Echoes the multitudinous meditation.

Epigram 

The greatest Gifts that Nature does bestow,
Can't unassisted to Perfection grow:
A scanty Fortune clips the Wings of Fame,
And checks the Progress of a rising Name;
Each dastard Vertue drags a Captive's Chain,
And moves but slowly, for it moves with Pain.
Domestick Cares sit hard upon the Mind,
And cramp those Thoughts which shou'd be unconfin'd;
The Cries of Poverty alarm the Soul,
Abate its Vigour, its Designs controul:
The Stings of Want inflict the Wounds of Death,
And Motion always ceases with the Breath.
The Love of Friends is found a languid Fire,
That glares but faintly, and will soon expire;
Weak is its Force, nor can its Warmth be great,
A feeble Light begets a feeble Heat.
Wealth is the Fuel that must feed the Flame,
It dyes in Rags, and scarce deserves a Name.

A Peasant to his lord yearly court,
Presenting pippins of so rich a sort
That he, displeased to have a part alone,
Removed the tree, that all might be his own.
The tree, too old to travel, though before
So fruitful, withered, and would yield no more.
The squire, perceiving all his labour void,
Cursed his own pains, so foolishly employed,
And 'Oh,' he cried, 'that I had lived content
With tribute, small indeed, but kindly meant!
My avarice has expensive proved to me,
Has cost me both my pippins and my tree.'

Pallas And Venus An Epigram 

The Trojan swain had judged the great dispute,
And beauty's power obtain'd the golden fruit,
When Venus, loose in all her naked charms,
Met Jove's great daughter clad in shining arms,
The wanton goddess view'd the warlike maid
From head to foot, and tauntingly she said;
Yield sister; rival, yield: naked, you see,
I vanquish: guess how potent I should be,
If to the field I came in armour dress'd,
Dreadful like thine my shield, and terrible my crest!
The warrior goddess with disdain replied,
Thy folly, child, is equal to thy pride:
Let a brave enemy for once advise,
And Venus (if 'tis possible) be wise:
Thou to be strong must put off every dress;
Thy only armour is thy nakedness;
And more than once (or thou art much belied)
By Mars himself that armour has been tried.

Now Vot'ries 'fore the Shrines like Statues show,
And scarce the Men from Images we know;
Now Winters Palsey seizes ev'ry Age,
And none's so warm, but feels the Seasons Rage;
Even the bright Lillies and triumphant Red
Which o're Corinna's youthful cheeks are spred,
Look pale and bleak, and shew a purple hew,
And Violets staine, where Roses lately grew.
Galla alone, with wonder we behold,
Maintain her Spring, and still out-brave the Cold;
Her constant white does not to Frost give place,
Nor fresh Vermillion fade upon her face:

Looking so at home in the hot
Afternoon breeze, swaying and serene.

Beer was none, nor, I'll aver,
Scarce water to supply it.
On tip-toes
He comes and goes
About her bedside, brothers;
Lifts a bit
Of coverlet,
And whispers with the others.

O'er her head the blanket piles;
Snuggles under,
With a thunder;
Turns about and smiles.

Frame An Epistle 

Most of the things you made for meâ€”blanket-
chest, lapdesk, the armless rockerâ€”I gave
away to friends who could use them and not
be reminded of the hours lost there,
not having been witness to those designs,
the tedious finishes. But I did keep
the mirror, perhaps because like all mirrors,
most of these years it has been invisible,
part of the wall, or defined by reflectionâ€”
safeâ€”because reflection, after all, does change.
I hung it here in the front, dark hallway
of this house you will never see, so that
it might magnify the meager light,
become a lesser, backward window. No one
pauses long before it. But this morning,
as I put on my overcoat, then straightened
my hair, I saw outside my face its frame
you made for me, admiring for the first
time the way the cherry you cut and planed
yourself had darkened, just as you said it would.

Raised by remembrances of misused life,

It Just Takes Blindness Epistrophe 

Not by what we say but by what we do
Not by being silent can we prove what's true.
Not by passive stance can we make things right
Not by shades of gray is there black and white.
Not by being fearful can we keep our land,
Not by false illusions can our freedom stand.
Not by being cowards are the battles won,
Not by being still can many things be done.
It takes real men to stand and face the foe,
It takes truth in us to walk where we must go.
It takes every fiber here to negate the lies
It takes boldness to stop our own country's demise,
It takes unity of heart and one goal to find
It takes all the governed to speak out their mind
It takes just one man to bring utter destruction
It takes blindness to bring death to a nation.

A Cross Road Epitaph 

"Am Kreuzweg wird begraben
Wer selber brachte sich um."
When first the world grew dark to me
I call'd on God, yet came not he.
Whereon, as wearier wax'd my lot,
On Love I call'd, but Love came not.
When a worse evil did befall,
Death, on thee only did I call.

You did your duty,
And paid the ultimate price.

Missed so much by your loved ones.
In Gods tender care today.

An Epitaph For Keats 

THROUGH one, years since hanged and forgot

Here lieth one whoâ€”while Time's stream
Runneth, as God hath taught her,
Bearing man's fame to men,â€”will have
His great name writ in water.

An Epitaph From The Greek 

My name -- my country -- what are they to thee!
What, whether base or proud my pedigree?

Perhaps I fell below them all -- what then?
Suffice it, stranger! that thou seest a tomb--
Thou know'st its use -- it hides -- no matter whom.

An Epitaph On Niobe Turned To Stone 

This Pile thou seest built out of Flesh, not Stone,
Contains no shroud within, nor mouldring bone:
This bloodless Trunk is destitute of Tombe
Which may the Soul-fled Mansion enwombe.
This seeming Sepulchre (to tell the troth)
Is neither Tomb nor Body, and yet both.

An Epitaph On The Admirable Dramatic Poet W Shakespeare 

What needs my Shakespeare for his honored bones
The labor of an age in piled stones?
Or that his hallowed reliques should be hid
Under a star-ypointing pyramid?
Dear son of Memory, great heir of Fame,
What need'st thou such weak witness of thy name?
Thou in our wonder and astonishment
Hast built thy self a livelong monument.
For whilst, to th' shame of slow-endeavoring art,
Thy easy numbers flow, and that each heart
Hath from the leaves of thy unvalued book
Those Delphic lines with deep impression took,
Then thou, our fancy of itself bereaving,
Dost make us marble with too much conceiving,
And so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie
That kings for such a tomb would wish to die.
END

An Epitaph On The Late Lord Mount Cashel 

Children are snatch'd away sometimes,
To punish Parents for their Crimes.
Thy Mother's Merit was so great,
Heav'n hasten'd thy untimely Fate,
To make her Character complete.
Tho' many Virtues fill'd her Breast,
'Twas Resignation crown'd the rest.
END
Mary Barber


Poem Start
An Epitaph 

Enough; and leave the rest to Fame!
'Tis to commend her, but to name.
Courtship which, living, she declined,
When dead, to offer were unkind:
Nor can the truest wit, or friend,
Without detracting, her commend.
To say--she lived a virgin chaste
In this age loose and all unlaced;
Nor was, when vice is so allowed,
Of virtue or ashamed or proud;
That her soul was on Heaven so bent,
No minute but it came and went;
That, ready her last debt to pay,
She summ'd her life up every day;
Modest as morn, as mid-day bright,
Gentle as evening, cool as night:
--'Tis true; but all too weakly said.
'Twas more significant, she's dead.
END

An Epitaph

By ceaseless waves, that break and waste,

An Epitaph 

Here lies a most beautiful lady,
Light of step and heart was she;
I think she was the most beautiful lady
That ever was in the West Country.
But beauty vanishes, beauty passes;
However rare -- rare it be;
And when I crumble,who will remember
This lady of the West Country.

An Epitaph 

Here lies one who never drew
Blood himself, yet many slew;
Gave the gun its aim, and figure
Made in field, yet ne'er pulled trigger.
Armed men have gladly made
Him their guide, and him obeyed;
At his signified desire,
Would advance, present, and fire.
Stout he was, and large of limb,
Scores have fled at sight of him;
And to all his fame he rose
Only following his nose.
Neptune was he called; not he
Who controls the boisterous sea.
But of happier command,
Neptune of the furrowed land;
And, your wonder vain to shorten,
Pointer to Sir John Throckmorton.
END

An Epitaph Upon A Child 

Virgins promised when I died,

An Epitaph Upon A Virgin 

Here a solemn fast we keep,
While all beauty lies asleep;
Hush'd be all things, no noise here

An Epitaph Upon Husband And Wife 

TO these whom death again did wed
This grave 's the second marriage-bed.
For though the hand of Fate could force
'Twixt soul and body a divorce,
It could not sever man and wife,
Because they both lived but one life.
Peace, good reader, do not weep;
Peace, the lovers are asleep.
They, sweet turtles, folded lie
In the last knot that love could tie.
Let them sleep, let them sleep on,
Till the stormy night be gone,
And the eternal morrow dawn;
Then the curtains will be drawn,
And they wake into a light
Whose day shall never die in night.

The Poet of the Poor ;
His books were rivers, woods and skies,
The meadow and the moor;
His teachers were the torn heart's wail,
The tyrant and the slave,
The street, the factory, the jail,
The palace--arid the grave!
The meanest thing, earth's feeblest worm
He feared to scorn or hate;
And honour'd in a peasant's form
The equal of the great.
But if he lov'd the rich who make
The poor man's little more,
Ill could he praise the rich who take
From plundered labour's store.
A hand to do, a head to plan,
A heart to feet and dare--
Tell man's worst foes, here lies the man
Who drew them as they are.

Epitaph For A Darling Lady 

All her hours were yellow sands,
Blown in foolish whorls and tassels;
Slipping warmly through her hands;
Patted into little castles.
Shiny day on shiny day
Tumble in a rainbow clutter,
As she flipped them all away,
Sent them spinning down the gutter.
Leave for her a red young rose,
Go your way, and save your pity;
She is happy, for she knows
That her dust is very pretty.

Epitaph For A Romantic Woman 

She has attained the permanence
She dreamed of, where old stones lie sunning.
Untended stalks blow over her
Even and swift, like young men running.
Always in the heart she loved
Others had lived, -- she heard their laughter.
She lies where none has lain before,
Where certainly none will follow after.

Epitaph For Joseph Blackett Late Poet And Shoemaker 

Stranger! behold, interr'd together,
The souls of learning and of leather.
Poor Joe is gone, but left his all:
You'll find his relics in a stall.
His works were neat, and often found
Well stitch'd, and with morocco bound.
Tread lightly -- where the bard is laid
He cannot mend the shoe he made;
Yet is he happy in his hole,
With verse immortal as his sole.
But still to business he held fast,
And stuck to Phobus to the last.
Then who shall say so good a fellow
Was only 'leather and prunella?'
For character - he did not lack it
And if he did, 'twere shame to 'Black it.

Epitaph In A Church Yard In Charleston South Carolina 

GEORGE AUGUSTUS CLOUGH
A NATIVE OF LIVERPOOL,
DIED SUDDENLY OF "STRANGER'S FEVER"
NOV'R 5th 1843
AGED 22
He died of "Stranger's Fever" when his youth
Had scarcely melted into manhood, so
The chiselled legend runs; a brother's woe
Laid bare for epitaph. The savage ruth
Of a sunny, bright, but alien land, uncouth
With cruel caressing dealt a mortal blow,
And by this summer sea where flowers grow
In tropic splendor, witness to the truth
Of ineradicable race he lies.
The law of duty urged that he should roam,
Should sail from fog and chilly airs to skies
Clear with deceitful welcome. He had come
With proud resolve, but still his lonely eyes
Ached with fatigue at never seeing home.

Epitaph On A Disturber Of His Times 

We expected the violin's finger on the upturned nerve;
Its importunate cry, too laxly curved:
And you drew us an oboe-outline, clean and acute;
Unadorned statement, accurately carved.
We expected the screen, the background for reverie
Which cloudforms usefully weave:
And you built the immaculate, adamant, blue-green steel
Arch of a balanced wave.
We expected a pool with flowers to diffuse and break
The child-round face of the mirrored moon:
And you blazed a rock-path, begun near the sun, to be finished
By the trained and intrepid feet of men.

Epitaph On A Jacobite 

To my true king I offered free from stain
Courage and faith; vain faith, and courage vain.
For him, I threw lands, honours, wealth, away.
And one dear hope, that was more prized than they.
For him I languished in a foreign clime,
Grey-haired with sorrow in my manhood's prime;
Heard on Lavernia Scargill's whispering trees,
And pined by Arno for my lovelier Tees;
Beheld each night my home in fevered sleep,
Each morning started from the dream to weep;
Till God who saw me tried too sorely, gave
The resting place I asked, an early grave.
Oh thou, whom chance leads to this nameless stone,
From that proud country which was once mine own,
By those white cliffs I never more must see,
By that dear language which I spake like thee,
Forget all feuds, and shed one English tear
O'er English dust. A broken heart lies here.

The first time I died, I walked my ways;
I followed the file of limping days.
I held me tall, with my head flung up,
But I dared not look on the new moon's cup.
I dared not look on the sweet young rain,
And between my ribs was a gleaming pain.
The next time I died, they laid me deep.
They spoke worn words to hallow my sleep.
They tossed me petals, they wreathed me fern,
They weighted me down with a marble urn.
And I lie here warm, and I lie here dry,
And watch the worms slip by, slip by.

I lived in those times. For a thousand years
I have been dead. Not fallen, but hunted;
When all human decency was imprisoned,
I was free amongst the masked slaves.

I watched the river, the earth, the sky,
Turning around me, keeping their balance,
The seasons provided their birds and their honey.
You who live, what have you made of your luck?
Do you regret the time when I struggled?
Have you cultivated for the common harvest?
Have you enriched the town I lived in?
Living men, think nothing of me. I am dead.
Nothing survives of my spirit or my body.

Who hears a skylark and can hold a pen

You're not yet lovers. But in time to come

spearing space, and science-

Of Hope A Fourteener 

Hope flourishes as flower which, when watered, nurtured, sprouts -
but first seed must take root in garden free from shady doubts.
mind's probing fingers, working, plucking weeds that stunt,  consume;
strip  hazards from environment so seed of Hope can bloom.
while some say Hope's  perpetual and grows e'en without seed,
won't falter - feast or famine - and can withstand dirty deed.
I think more so Hope grows where effort made has clearly shown
that Faith was planted justly and then - Hope - the harvest grown.
Hope feeds upon a memory  of expectations met,
where struggles as a seedling then grows larger, stronger yet.
And bow-tied with a ribbon, Hope becomes a gift still more -
for Hope as gift soon shape-shifts until Faith stands at the door.
yet caution wise to realize that Hope, when falsly gained
as dissapointment underlies; Faith/Hope fails - none retained.
let application/ action then help Hope become a tree,
the end result - a gift to self - instilled in me by me.

Again Thanks I Am Giving Ghazal 

In my life there is room after room of good things
my man is one room for whom thanks-I-am-giving.
.
I do not know what good seeds I have been sowing
but for not reaping from my bad deeds thanks-I-am-giving.
.
Every day my life kite through the sky is tripping
and through good times and bad times is zipping but thanks-I-am-giving.
.
The morning breeze a brand new essence is bringing
and blessings like flowers are budding and blooming and thanks-I-am giving.
.
When adventure comes a-horseback and hoofbeats are reigning
then the hills are ringing and singing with thanks-I-am-giving.

A Ghazal He And We 

wind water earth sky - all things remain the same
for our Lord in heaven above we are but a game
He tests us at every step if we fail
not He but we're ourselves to blame
all day the devotees throng His shrine
chanting His name spreading His fame
desires they've sown for ages in their hearts
if they don't sprout won't it be His shame?
deaf He may be to my pleas, uni,
don't think on His love i'll forego my claim.

A Ghazal I Feel Lost 

I don't know why, it's strange but true-
I feel lost in front of you
Virtues in me are too many,
You take only a bird's eye-view.
What is all this roaming about?
Why is life a wandering Jew?
In this world of tasks undone,
Days are like the morning dew.
Here's a city of millions where,
Uni's  been seeking  friends few.

A Ghazal In English 

The buds of wishes have grown and became flowers, now.
The fragrance of it is spreading to all parts and directions, now.
What my mind conceived and heart did not endorse
Has remained like a storybook in shelf, now.
The waves of my youth life that reached its zenith
Has started to calm down year by year, now.
The inner voice of my conscience
Has become an unsolved question, now.
The stroke of my pen produced a poetry
Like the Taj Mahal, a symbol of love, now.

A Ghazal Of Amir Kazalbash Translation 

life's an evening without dawn, buddy
why are you awake all night, buddy?
i'm weary of travelling on and on,
when will this journey end, buddy?
why does the sea turn into a mirage,
have you any inkling of this, buddy?

A Ghazal Traveller O 

Traveller O, why your feet have halted there?
Your terminus is still nowhere near.
Hear the brook that goes on singing in the woods,
See the clouds that go on sailing in the air.
All who came to see you off were not your friends,
Some had for you neath their sleeves daggers bare.
Thank them all alike and wish a happy life,
God Almighty high above takes your care.
Make some music with your footfalls on the road,
Milestones that lie ahead would like to hear.

A Rattlesnake Moon Ghazal 

Have you ever, he said, seen a rattlesnake moon?
Never, ever, I said. What's a rattlesnake moon?
One that captures solar light, soaking up its heat.
Surely, I said, I have seen that rattlesnake moon.
One that holds you tight with its swoon of dreamy light.
Oh, I said, I've been bitten by rattlesnake moon.
One that strikes, injects you with the bite of love.
Yes, I said, a victim of a rattlesnake moon.
One that shuns the clouds driving the shadows away.
That, I said, could not be a rattlesnake moon.
One that sheds it skin at night, bedevils in black.
How, I said, I gladly miss that rattlesnake moon.
One that frightens daylight out of you with delight.
Ah, I said, Ben told me of that rattlesnake moon.

Wish in your heart I get access sweetheart.

Pass a few days of recess lifelong sweetheart.

Now face with smile consequences sweetheart.
Surrender unconditional, I shall impose on you,
Imprisonment of life, are sentences sweetheart.
A night is followed after all sunny days,

Bridge Ghazal 

My love and I reside upon the belly of a bridge
with heartbeats of the sky?--the drums upon the bridge.
I've heard of songs that rise at night from pitch black oceans.
I've heard the strums of lyrics made by four hands on a bridge.
My love and I do landscapes for the gardens of the sea.
At night we sleep as seedlings at the center of its bridge.
Once I saw a Sufi breathe in seabirds, and send them out again.
I've seen people bearing blindfolds near the entrance of a bridge.
My love's old love, he says, had tried to douse him in a moat.
He grew gills to save himself and hid beneath a drawbridge.
The masters speak of magic at the middle of the rings
where Yes and No chase each other round the props of any bridge.
My love's new love, some say, makes far too much of things
as fundamental, elemental, as the structure of a bridge.
Anonymous submission.

Cheesy Moon Ghazal 

Look up and gaze at craters on the cheesy moon.
A cow, a spoon jumping over the cheesy moon.
Opening the refrigerator, what cheese now?
How about more of tasty, crusty, cheesy moon?
Dare I taste the zesty tang of pepper-jack cheese,
Mix and dance with the tango of a cheesy moon?
My office cloudy, loveless, lifeless gray
Could use some life-giving zest of a cheesy moon.
Brie and Camenbert, Ben loves soft and crusty cheese,
Swiss and GruyÃ¨re with wide eyes opened, cheesy moon.

Conjugal Life Ghazal 

Life that is past in love is life, nothing is rest,
It's good it's better no doubt is the best.
Two birds ignorant what happens in the world,
Satisfied, content and happy in the nest!
Feeding outcomes of love with the nibs,
Great glimpses of God on a real loving test!
Playing with young ones teaching how to fly,
Imitation is a teacher with mighty manifest.
Provisions scattered on the bosom of the earth,
Leading young ones to a mother at her best!
It's life, it's prayer, it's what God wants to see,
When birds fly high they fly with a crest.
I am sure in the gardens of high skies,
In flowers of diamonds and pearls is a nest,
Where birds incubate there golden eggs,
Fairies are in fact an outcome of the crest.

Fawn Ghazal 

Inside a snowy blanket which put the trees to sleep,
I heard a fawn.
Out past the window's ice coat in the morning, I
found a sleeping fawn.
There are men in yellow kitchens watching hands of
brown-eyed women
while men in orange jackets dream in secret, of
capturing a fawn.
When I was younger I was taught, but have forgotten,
sweet timidity.
When I am older I will learn, by necessity, the
light-footedness of fawns.
Someone left a lily on my doorstep, eggshell white
with speckled leaves;
the card of introduction said the flower's name was
Fawn.
Sages wonder if it's possible for men to turn to
animals.
I wonder if they've pondered the agility of fawns.

Ghazal01 

O beautiful wine-bearer, bring forth the cup and put it to my lips
Path of love seemed easy at first, what came was many hardships.
With its perfume, the morning breeze unlocks those beautiful locks
The curl of those dark ringlets, many hearts to shreds strips.
In the house of my Beloved, how can I enjoy the feast
Since the church bells call the call that for pilgrimage equips.
With wine color your robe, one of the old Magiâ€™s best tips
Trust in this travelerâ€™s tips, who knows of many paths and trips.
The dark midnight, fearful waves, and the tempestuous whirlpool
How can he know of our state, while ports house his unladen ships.
I followed my own path of love, and now I am in bad repute
How can a secret remain veiled, if from every tongue it drips?
If His presence you seek, Hafiz, then why yourself eclipse?
Stick to the One you know, let go of imaginary trips.

Where is sermon and hymn, & the violin's music whence.
Upon seeing our friend, our foes put up their defense
Where is a dead lantern, & the candle of the sun whence?
My eye-liner is the dust of your door and fence
Where shall I go, tell me, you command me whence?
Take your focus from your chin to the trap on the path hence,
Where to O heart, in such hurry you go whence?

O wind of springtime! Don't annoy [me] and move on your way
You intend to play whereas I feel wretched
Because of feebleness I feel, for hours together
To rest wherever I find the shadow of a wall

You who are not kept anxiously awake for love's sake, sleep on.
In restless search for that river, we hurry along;
you whose heart such anxiety has not disturbed, sleep on.
Love's place is out beyond the many separate sects;
since you love choosing and excluding, sleep on.
Love's dawn cup is our sunrise, his dusk our supper;
you whose longing is for sweets and whose passion is for supper, sleep on.
In search of the philosopher's stone, we are melting like copper;
you whose philosopher's stone is cushion and pillow, sleep on.
I have abandoned hope for my brain and head; you who wish for
a clear head and fresh brain, sleep on.

In the absence of lover the God of love pesters the beloved
The heart doesn't relax unless it beholds the lover
The body too gets satiated when it meets with the lover

Bring the voice of the lover and make me gratified
The divine blessing would grow to be the seeker of sin
The purity of the sarong would envy that
I don't fancy the brightness of the candle sans the face of my lover
For my being prefers the brightness of his face
When the moonlit night arrives it troubles me
For the moon incenses the eyes of the beloved

Macmillan was never thine, Kennedy can never be
Hindustan belongs to me and Pakistan belongs to me
This land in fact, my dear, belongs to peasants and workers
Here will not run the writ of a few clannish marauders
The dawn of freedom is heralding the end of tyranny
Hindustan belongs to me and Pakistan belongs to me.

Ghazal 

Suspicion consumed me
As it does to this day
Lined by desire
I hid the wounds in my heart
You make it all end in tears
Values are abandoned
As if a thorn were pulled out of my heart
Tears spill from my eyes
Lights still burn but the place is deserted
Once faith was unshakeable
A head of snow at my shoulder
Once we were a tongue of flame
Loneliness is my twin
Were there ever such twins before?
[Translated by Nuzhat Jabinh]

Ghazal 

I wish to go and dwell,
In such a place,
Where there's no one else.
No one to understand my speech,
No one around to talk with,
There, I want to reach.
I wish to build,
One such house,
Without a door to enter,
Without the boundary walls,
Thus there will be no neighbours,
And there will be no guard.
There will be no one thus,
To take care of me,
When I will fell ill.
And there will be no one,
To mourn or cry,
When I will die.

Ghazal 

Hum se tark e ulfat jo us ne ki
Der tak us ke chehra udaas raha
Bewafyun ki ek unkhuli kitab
Us ka her safa roodad sonata raha
Us ki ankhon mein neend ki srgoshian
Bekhawabi mein kuch khwab dekhata araha
Mon morh ke us ne chalte howaiy
Dekha tu kuch lumha wo khamosh raha
Jab khili nai komplain bahar ki
Wo apne labon ko chotha raha
Use maloom tha hoga na  kuch magar
Sara khazana us ke dil mein chupa raha
Apne ko to ye umeed bhi na thee k ek din
Dabe pawon wo meri therf aata raha
Kuch nai din ki roshni mein talash kerna
Andheri raat mein aksar bhtaktaa araha

Ghazal Rat Ke Pardon Mein Sahmi Si Mulaqat Nahin 

Rat ke pardon mein sahmi si mulaqat nahin,
Ek muddat se woh mehke hue din rat nahin.
Teri madhosh jawani ki inayat nahin,
Shokh nazron mein woh rangeen isharat namin.
Bat keya apni sunaen jo teri bat nahin,
Woh tasawar hi nahin ab woh kheyalat nahin.
Ab nahin waslke hangamon mein lazzat baqi,
Ab tere hijr ke woh pehle se sadmat nahin.

Ghazal Roshni Ko Maut Aai 

Khuloos-o-mehr mite dosti ko maut aai,

Kahan geya ke meri dilkashi ko maut aai.
Woh kaun tha woh kahan ka tha bolta keya tha,
Keya itna kafi nahin aadmi ko maut aai.
Main rahggeer tha ek bezarar sa shahri tha,
Main kab mara hoon meri bebasi ko maut aai.
Woh barson sath raha nam tak na poocha kabhi,
Mere pados men ek ajnabi ko maut aai.

Tu baz aaya agar khudkushi ko maut aai.

Hungry Moon Ghazal 

It slowly creeps across the sky prowling for escapades, that hungry moon.
Darling, come with me, flirt with the night, Iâ€™ll protect you from that hungry moon.
Weâ€™ll dance the habanera and let it have its way with us all the night.
Then weâ€™ll slip into the darkness under the shadow of that hungry moon.
With the conversation of the dance weâ€™ll outshout cries from that hungry moon.
Together weâ€™ll evade the ever-watching eyes of evry hungry moon.
Weâ€™ll outrun the loneliness that has stalked us throughout the slow-turning day.
A long day awaited, gobbled up during the night by a hungry moon.
Weâ€™ll look into the dream-lit stars until weâ€™re dizzy, remember this night.
Weâ€™ll head for the shadows where it is darkest, away from the hungry moon.
With the swooping and snatching of an owl as it seizes its frozen prey,
I will not leave you in the shadows of the night or prey to that hungry moon.
Like a yelping dog, with the name of Ben, weâ€™ll be racing across the ridge.
Encircled in my arms Iâ€™ll protect you then from that ever-hungry moon.

In The Woods Ghazal 

Each morning I take a lonely stroll in the woods.
Enter the romantic reverence of the woods.
An avian symphony grace me company.
En plein air I sense warming comfort in the woods.
Phasing colors of a youthful sun shadow me.
What deep memories are held captive in the woods.
Pictorial web of endless variety.
Shuffling, wading through the wilderness of the woods.
Liquid mosaic in the marshes dazzles me.
Wearing through the deep mysteria of the woods.
The breezes whisper their secrets eternally.
A final wish mine/ashes dreaming in the woods.

Just Sugar Sweet Sugar Ghazal 

The mountains loomed high, the valleys of rivers reflected sparkling crystals all of sugar.
There were beets and there were canes and as far as the eye could see just sugar, sweet sugar.
Nothing black, nothing sour, not even a hint of bitterness
from east to west, north to south in this landscape of sugar.
My eyes licked those mountain  slopes, my lips slurped up
those valley streams sprinkled with crystals of sugar.
Sliding down the mountains, skittering down,
a mountain slide of sugar â€“ miles and miles of sugar.
White stallions thundering over the plains, white rabbits scampering
over the hills - invisible against vast sheets of snow sugar.
Sounds of music flooding through earthâ€™s atmospheric filter,
all I can hear now is the resonant sounds of sugar.

Living In Bowling Green Ghazal 

Excuse me, but my favorite color isnâ€™t green
Even though I live in the city of Bowling Green.
In its history the people played such lively games.
On many sunny days their fun was bowling on the Green.
In his boyhood here there lived a man named Duncan Hines.
One day you might find his colored cakes in Irish green.
Oh yes, this city is the home of the car Corvette.
If it pleases you, you can own one painted blue green.
The school my son attended here was Bowling Green High.
His closest friend in French class was Emily Green.
About once a week I visit our Bowling Green Mall.
There you can plainly see its signs printed all in green.
With pollution and economy the way they are,
I am happy to see the city still going green.

Love A Ghazal An Experiment 

My soul smiles with the flowers of your love,
Pleasant and soothing are the showers of your love.
I can go any time but I don't know why,
I love this cage in the towers of your love.
How sweet are the dreams in a shadow so dense!
I love to sleep in the bowers of your love.
In love of a beauty I am odor and color,
So many thanks to the mowers of your love.
How weak I was how strong I am,
I bow my head to the powers of your love.

Many flowers sprung by sowers of your love.
Is it your beauty that I describe,
Or it's just the avowers of your love.

Often Based On A Ghazal By Aarzoo Mehek 

You are in habit of avoiding me often?
But you are in habit of loving me often!
I am in habit of erasing me in love,
for erasing I love writing me often.
Loneliness is the cause of my craziness,
But I love a lonely roaming often.
Promises he loves to make so much,
with a habit of denying me often!
In your love I've earned a too bad name,
thanks for your love framing me often.
Sufficient for sinking, your too deep eyes,
a naughtiness too crazing me often.
Oh pleasure of love, the peace you provide,
is followed by fires  burning me often.

Pleasantries Ghazal 

Fly like a kite in the passion of storms,
Why don't you love and enjoy its charms.
Sink yourself in the ocean of two eyes,
Life is between two lovely soft arms.
Kiss smile of roses that blossom on her face,
Kiss line of love in the pair of her palms.
Those in love are nice gentlemen,
If one is deprived he loses his norms.
Kiss the mirror while watching your face,
Love is a beauty whatever may its forms.
Why are you burning in the fire of hate?
Look at the ashes of the melting norms.
Get rid of hate it's a friend you need,
See magic of love that a friend performs.
Forgive your enemy send a bouquet to him,
Melt ice of the past with a gift that warms.

Icing of the cake is love that warms.
At least exchange few words that are pleasant,
It's eve of Christmas bid farewell to the arms.

Princess Was Crowned As The Ruling Queen Ghazal 

When a voice is not heard it's nicely seen,
When ears are inactive my eyes are keen.
In all my senses it's touch instrumental,
Sixth sense of the soul is a touch unseen.
How bold is your heart my shy beloved!
Heard all untold and I saw the unseen.
Language of love is truly universal,
The body language celebrates Halloween.
Long hairs when silky and perfumed as well,
Comb of fingers learns how to preen.
I asked you agreed no words exchanged,
I never knew so simple it has been.
So all the senses touched her at last,
Spectrum of life is pink and green.
In a moonlit night that was cloudy and wet,
Princess was crowned as the ruling queen.

Saga Of Stone Ghazal 

Where to begin and then end this saga of stone;
On Mt. Sinai with the Ten Commandments of stone?
With the mighty megaliths of Britainâ€™s Stonehenge?
Start we will from the beginning when there was stone.
Centuries ago some built fires in caves of stone;
Drew wild animals and hunters on walls of stone.
On dark nights some read moving stars, measured the moon;
And for each month some chose a special precious stone.
Behold the pyramids and amphitheaters
Enduring the centuries - monuments of stone.
Nothing is more lasting than a flat slab of rock;
Why streams flow along many pebbled beds of stone.
As people reborn some live the life of the Son;
His stone from the tomb found rolled back on Easter morn.
Relieving us all of weariness in our bones,
Fateful death lays us low at the foot of a stone.
Content will I be with B. J. G. chiseled there
While forever reposing in that outer zone.

Seasons Of The Heart Ghazal 

All the calendars measure the months of the seasons;
None of them painting the same scenario for all.
Still all know the reasons for the different seasons.
The sea goes its own way being a world all its own.
The climatic law of the land is washed away.
Those that sail the oceans learn of different seasons.
Then thereâ€™s the world of fine food not without its seasons.
Every chef knows how to season the food he cooks
Whether it be for health or even the taste of the season.
Age is not content to contemplate just four seasons.
With love there are many seasons of the heart to explore.
I for one know some but, by far, not all its seasons.
We are not beyond the influence of outer space.
Not only the oceans are subject to the moonâ€™s pull.
It would do us well to understand the moonâ€™s seasons.
Sharing is a must to accompany our reasons
If we truly intend to know all of heartâ€™s seasons.
No one, even I, knows all of heartâ€™s many seasons.

Sugar On My Mind Ghazal 

Can we think of anything sweet and not think of sugar?
There are just two many things that remind us of sugar.
We all have inner pulsing passions for pleasures of a sugarland.
It isnâ€™t just bears who hibernate and search for honey-flowing sugar.
We are always searching new horizons like so many venturers before,
willing to sail seas and oceans in our quest for exotic spices and sugar.
When I taste your sweetness within with a kiss,
Itâ€™s no wonder that I seek all your sweetness of sugar.
Gliding over the curves and mounds of your body quivering with
whispering traces, soft and delicate as an Acuna baby eating sugar.
Like dazzling sugar crystals your eyes sweeten
my longings for your gift of sugarland.
Baby Ben, you loved all the sweets of boyhood sugar.
Now Big Ben, you canâ€™t easily do without sugar.

That Fellow Moon Ghazal 

When I first saw you, I felt a hello-moon,
Like I was phasing into a tallow moon,
Sitting in a chair/hands moving/crocheting,
And I longed only for your allow-me moon.
A sweater, scarf â€“ I really didnâ€™t notice.
My eyes were still hazy with a sallow moon.
Watching your fingers back and forth back and forth.
My swaying and shimmering with a jello-moon,
Wanting to learn the warp of your creating,
Caught up in the glowing of a halo-moon.
Teach me teach me how your Christmas fingers fly.
Iâ€™m ripe for learning/spring in this fallow moon.
Drawn into your eyes I feel their allure.

Wordsworth and Shelley and Keats are sung.
Tide of beauty brings out many pearls,
Ugliness sweeps out like dirt and dung.
My days are yours my nights are yours,
You are a song round the clock it's sung.
I remember sweetheart a heart I had,
With your earrings something is hung.
I cannot see if your eyes are wet,
My heart with you, see never it's wrung.

Whispers With The Sweet Heart A Ghazal An Experiment 

Not important sweetheart what your brain concedes,
Important is the truth of your heart it feeds.
Not important sweetheart, how much knowledge you have,
Important is application when you sow its seeds.
Not important sweetheart, how nice is your belief,
Important is its reflection in your day to day deeds.
Not important sweetheart your outer charms,
Important is attraction from inside that pleads.
Not important sweetheart the smiles and joys,
Important is attention to the eye that bleeds.
Not important sweetheart forget your sins,
Important is regression after human misdeeds,
Not important sweetheart, how much I love you,
Important is my passion in the time of needs.

Wo Ghazal Walon Ka Usloob Samajhte Honge 

Wo ghazal walon ka usloob samajhte honge
Chand kahte hein kise khoob samajhte honge
Itni milti hai miri ghazlon se sutat teri
Log tujh ko mira mehboob samjhte honge
Dekh kar phool key sathaat pe shabnam kuchh log
Mera ashkon bhara maktoob samajhte honge
Bhool kar apna zaman a ye buzurgane jadeed
Aaj ke pyar ko mayoob samajhte honge

Yell O Ghazal 

Not much comes to mind now as I think of something yellow
Except that Beetle Song that happens to mention yellow.
I do not care to cite a certain bird I know by name
Which of all living colors has a belly gleaming yellow
And how can I forget the time that youthful Dorothy
Sauntered with her friends along that road whose bricks were yellow.
So how am I to continue and finish this poem piece
If I canâ€™t conjure more things which know the color yellow?
Let me see â€” are there fruits I know with that color? .
Is it a lemon thatâ€™s lemon colored or all yellow?
As I now recall, I can see there being in the fields
Some flowers still growing wild and proud of beaming yellow.
And last of all, I want to close with one fulfilling thought.
I wish to be the one who hears that harvest moon yell, O!

You And I A Ghazal Of Rumi 

Joyous, blissful moment, sitting on the porch, you and I
two forms, two faces, yet one soul together, you and I
The groves' gift, the birds' songs give us the water of ever
lasting life, when we come to the garden together, you and I
The stars of the night sky witness us
we show them the moon together, you and I
You and I united as one in ecstasy and delight
cast aside absurd stories and nonsense, you and I
The parrots of the sky eat sugar when we are
in the veranda, laughing together, you and I
How amazing are we here this moment in this corner
yet we are also together in IrÃ¢q and KhorÃ¢sÃ¢n, you and I
We are in one form on the earth and in another in the
everlasting land of honey - the paradise, you and I

O corpo nÃ£o espera. NÃ£o. Por nÃ³s

a tÃ©pida secura acetinada,
a que palpita por adivinhada
em solitÃ¡rios movimentos vÃ£os;
este pousar em que nÃ£o estamos nÃ³s,
mas uma sede, uma memÃ³ria, tudo
o que sabemos de tocar desnudo
o corpo que nÃ£o espera: este pousar
que nÃ£o conhece, nada vÃª, nem nada
ousa temer no seu temor agudo...
Tem tanta pressa o corpo! E jÃ¡ passou,

Collection Of Six Haiku 

Waking in the night;
the lamp is low,
the oil freezing.
It has rained enough
to turn the stubble on the field
black.
Winter rain
falls on the cow-shed;
a cock crows.
The leeks
newly washed white,-
how cold it is!
The sea darkens;
the voices of the wild ducks
are faintly white.
Ill on a journey;
my dreams wander
over a withered moor.

Five Haiku 

The wind
Undecided
Rolls a cigarette of air
The mute girl talks:
It is art's imperfection.
This impenetrable speech.
The motor car is truly launched:
Four martyrs' heads
Roll under the wheels.
Ah! a thousand flames, a fire,
The light, a shadow!
The sun is following me.
A feather gives to a hat
A touch of lightness:
The chimney smokes.

Spring:
A hill without a name
Veiled in morning mist.
The beginning of autumn:
Sea and emerald paddy
Both the same green.

Blow: yet still green
The chestnut husks.
A flash of lightning:
Into the gloom
Goes the heron's cry.

The religion game
only one right way; there can

Fear haunts such small minds
seeing through their broken glass,
blind leading the blind.
No heaven no hell
can remove love from within;
relax and just BREATHE.
The Spirit indwells
beyond the understanding.
A whispering Love
whose strength surrounds us,
guides us along each day; just what
is it, we should fear?

Drifting meadow of the air,
Where bloom the dasied banks and violets,

Bear only purfumes and the scent
Of healing herbs to just men's fields!

A Hymn In Praise Of Neptune 

OF Neptune's empire let us sing,
At whose command the waves obey;
To whom the rivers tribute pay,
Down the high mountains sliding:
To whom the scaly nation yields
Homage for the crystal fields
Wherein they dwell:
And every sea-dog pays a gem
Yearly out of his wat'ry cell
To deck great Neptune's diadem.
The Tritons dancing in a ring
Before his palace gates do make
The water with their echoes quake,
Like the great thunder sounding:
The sea-nymphs chant their accents shrill,
And the sirens, taught to kill
With their sweet voice,
Make ev'ry echoing rock reply
Unto their gentle murmuring noise
The praise of Neptune's empery.

A Hymn To Frost 

Old leaves have no defence against the wind.
A gray hawk is October's inner cry.
The bells of Salem church play elegies.
Distance becomes a single snowflake's fall.
The mood is blue as autumn's last frost flowers,
Small bits of heaven hidden in the grass.
Tom Roach who called them by their favored name,
Went home across the green fields long ago.
Yet sometimes when the light moves slowly west,
And bells summon a faithful few for prayers,
I see his shadow picking a bouquet.
To live in memory is to be alive.
For my grandfather who started to work in the coal mines of West Virginia when he was twelve years old.

A Hymn To God The Father 

Wilt thou forgive that sin where I begun,
Which was my sin, though it were done before?
Wilt thou forgive that sin, through which I run,
And do run still, though still I do deplore?
When thou hast done, thou hast not done,
For I have more.
Wilt thou forgive that sin which I have won
Others to sin, and made my sin their door?
Wilt thou forgive that sin which I did shun
A year or two, but wallow'd in, a score?
When thou hast done, thou hast not done,
For I have more.
I have a sin of fear, that when I have spun
My last thread, I shall perish on the shore;
But swear by thyself, that at my death thy Son
Shall shine as he shines now, and heretofore;
And, having done that, thou hast done;
I fear no more.

A Hymn To The Graces 

When I love, as some have told
Love I shall, when I am old,
O ye Graces!  make me fit
For the welcoming of it!
Clean my rooms, as temples be,
To entertain that deity;
Give me words wherewith to woo,
Suppling and successful too;
Winning postures; and withal,
Manners each way musical;
Sweetness to allay my sour
And unsmooth behaviour:
For I know you have the skill
Vines to prune, though not to kill;
And of any wood ye see,
You can make a Mercury.

Kiss the altar, and confess

An Hymn To The Evening 

SOON as the sun forsook the eastern main
The pealing thunder shook the heav'nly plain;
Majestic grandeur!  From the zephyr's wing,
Exhales the incense of the blooming spring.
Soft purl the streams, the birds renew their notes,
And through the air their mingled music floats.
Through all the heav'ns what beauteous dies are
spread!
But the west glories in the deepest red:
So may our breasts with ev'ry virtue glow,
The living temples of our God below!
Fill'd with the praise of him who gives the light,
And draws the sable curtains of the night,
Let placid slumbers sooth each weary mind,
At morn to wake more heav'nly, more refin'd;
So shall the labours of the day begin
More pure, more guarded from the snares of sin.
Night's leaden sceptre seals my drowsy eyes,

Aurora hail, and all the thousand dies,
Which deck thy progress through the vaulted skies:
The morn awakes, and wide extends her rays,
On ev'ry leaf the gentle zephyr plays;
Harmonious lays the feather'd race resume,
Dart the bright eye, and shake the painted plume.
Ye shady groves, your verdant gloom display
To shield your poet from the burning day:
Calliope awake the sacred lyre,
While thy fair sisters fan the pleasing fire:
The bow'rs, the gales, the variegated skies
In all their pleasures in my bosom rise.
See in the east th' illustrious king of day!
His rising radiance drives the shades away--
But Oh! I feel his fervid beams too strong,
And scarce begun, concludes th' abortive song.

An Hymn To The Muses 

Honour to you who sit
Near to the well of wit,
And drink your fill of it!
Glory and worship be
To you, sweet Maids, thrice three,
Who still inspire me;
And teach me how to sing
Unto the lyric string,
My measures ravishing!
Then, while I sing your praise,
My priest-hood crown with bays
Green to the end of days!

Anniversary Hymn 

[sung to tune: "All Saints New"]
Our fathers, in the years grown dim, reared slowly, wall by wall
A holy dwelling-place for Him, that filleth all in all.
They wrought His house of faith and prayer, the rainbow round the Throne,
A precious temple builded fair on Christ the Cornerstone.
The Angel of the Golden Reed hath found the measure strait'
He hears the Great Foundation plead for ampler wall and gate.
The living pillars of the Truth grown on from morn to morn,
And still the heresy of youth is age's creed outworn.
But steadfast is their inner shrine wrought of the heart's fine gold,
Its hunger and its thirst divine, with jewels manifold,
Red sard of pain, hope's emerald gleam, white peace, no glory missed
Of righteous life and saintly dream, Jasper to amethyst.
Spirit of Truth, forbid that we who now God's temple are
And keep the faith with minds more free, our father's fabric mar.
Better than thoughts the stars that search is self still sacrificed,
For only Love can build the church whose corner-stone is Christ.

Concord Hymn 

By the rude bridge that arched the flood,
Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,
Here once the embattled farmers stood
And fired the shot heard round the world.
The foe long since in silence slept;
Alike the conqueror silent sleeps;
And Time the ruined bridge has swept
Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.
On this green bank, by this soft stream,
We set today a votive stone;
That memory may their deed redeem,
When, like our sires, our sons are gone.
Spirit, that made those heroes dare
To die, and leave their children free,
Bid Time and Nature gently spare
The shaft we raise to them and thee.

Hymn100 

Believe and be saved.
John 3:16-18.
Not to condemn the sons of men,
Did Christ, the Son of God, appear;
No weapons in his hands are seen,
No flaming sword nor thunder there.
Such was the pity of our God,
He loved the race of man so well,
He sent his Son to bear our load
Of sins, and save our souls from hell.
Sinners, believe the Savior's word,
Trust in his mighty name and live;
A thousand joys his lips afford,
His hands a thousand blessings give.
But vengeance and damnation lies
On rebels who refuse the grace;
Who God's eternal Son despise,
The hottest hell shall be their place.

Joy in heaven for a repenting sinner.
Luke 15:7,10.
Who can describe the joys that rise
Through all the courts of Paradise,
To see a prodigal return,
To see an heir of glory born?
With joy the Father doth approve
The fruit of his eternal love;
The Son with joy looks down and sees
The purchase of his agonies.
The Spirit takes delight to view
The holy soul he formed anew;
And saints and angels join to sing,
The growing empire of their King.

A state of nature and of grace.
1 Cor. 6:10,11.
Not the malicious or profane,
The wanton or the proud,
Nor thieves, nor sland'rers, shall obtain
Tue kingdom of our God.
Surprising grace! and such were we
By nature and by sin,
Heirs of immortal misery,
Unholy and unclean.
But we are washed in Jesus' blood,
We're pardoned through his name;
And the good Spirit of our God
Has sanctified our frame.
O for a persevering power
To keep thy just commands
We would defile our hearts no more,
No more pollute our hands.

Or crucify the Lord again,
And open all his wounds?
Forbid it, mighty God!
Nor let it e'er be said,

Should raise them from the dead.

Since Christ has made us free;
Has nailed our tyrants to his cross,

No more, my God, I boast no more
Of all the duties I have done;

To trust the merits of thy Son.
Now, for the love I bear his name,
What was my gain I count my loss;
My former pride I call my shame,
And nail my glory to his cross.
Yes, and I must and will esteem
All things but loss for Jesus' sake:
O may my soul be found in him,
And of his righteousness partake!
The best obedience of my hands
Dares not appear before thy throne;
But faith can answer thy demands
By pleading what my Lord has done.

The brazen serpent; or, Looking to Jesus.
John 3:14-16.
So did the Hebrew prophet raise
The brazen serpent high,
The wounded felt immediate ease,
The camp forbore to die.
"Look upward in the dying hour,
And live," the prophet cries;
But Christ performs a nobler cure,
When Faith lifts up her eyes.
High on the cross the Savior hung,
High in the heav'ns he reigns:
Here sinners by th' old serpent stung
Look, and forget their pains.
When God's own Son is lifted up,
A dying world revives;
The Jew beholds the glorious hope,
Th' expiring Gentile lives.

How large the promise, how divine,
To Abram and his seed!
"I'll be a God to thee and thine,
Supplying all their need."
The words of his extensive love
From age to age endure;
The Angel of the cov'nant proves,
And seals the blessing sure.
Jesus the ancient faith confirms,
To our great fathers giv'n;
He takes young children to his arms,
And calls them heirs of heav'n.
Our God, how faithful are his ways!
His love endures the same;
Nor from the promise of his grace
Blots out the children's name.

Faith of things unseen.
Heb. 11
Faith is the brightest evidence
Of things beyond our sight,
Breaks through the clouds of flesh and sense,
And dwells in heav'nly light.
It sets times past in present view,
Brings distant prospects home,
Of things a thousand years ago,
Or thousand years to come.
By faith we know the worlds were made
By God's almighty word;
Abram, to unknown countries led,
By faith obeyed the Lord.
He sought a city fair and high,
Built by th' eternal hands,
And faith assures us, though we die,
That heav'nly building stands.

Children devoted to God. [For those who practise infant Baptism.]

I'll bless thy num'rous race, and they
Shall be a seed for me."
Abram believed the promised grace,
And gave his sons to God;
But water seals the blessing now,
That once was sealed with blood.
Thus Lydia sanctified her house,
When she received the word;
Thus the believing jailer gave
His household to the Lord.

His sharp distress, his sore complaints,
By his last groans, his dying blood,
I charge my soul to love the saints.
Clamor, and wrath, and war, begone,
Envy and spite, for ever cease;
Let bitter words no more be known
Amongst the saints, the sons of peace.
The Spirit, like a peaceful dove,
Flies from the realms of noise and strife:
Why should we vex and grieve his love
Who seals our souls to heav'nly life?
Tender and kind be all our thoughts,
Through all our lives let mercy run;
So God forgives our num'rous faults,
For the dear sake of Christ his Son.

Hymn96 

Election excludes boasting.
1 Cor. 1:26-31.
But few among the carnal wise,
But few of noble race,
Obtain the favor of thine eyes,
Almighty King of Grace.
He takes the men of meanest name
For sons and heirs of God;
And thus he pours abundant shame
On honorable blood.
He calls the fool, and makes him know
The myst'ries of his grace,
To bring aspiring wisdom low,
And all its pride abase.
Nature has all its glories lost
When brought before his throne;
No flesh shall in his presence boast,
But in the Lord alone.

Hymn Consecration Of Magnolia Cemetery 

Whose was the hand that painted thee, O Death!
In the false aspect of a ruthless foe,
Despair and sorrow waiting on thy breath --
O gentle Power! who could have wronged thee so?
Thou rather shouldst be crowned with fadeless flowers,
Of lasting fragrance and celestial hue;
Or be thy couch amid funereal bowers,
But let the stars and sunlight sparkle through.
So, with these thoughts before us, we have fixed
And beautified, O Death! thy mansion here,
Where gloom and gladness -- grave and garden -- mixed,
Make it a place to love, and not to fear.
Heaven! shed thy most propitious dews around!
Ye holy stars! look down with tender eyes,
And gild and guard and consecrate the ground
Where we may rest, and whence we pray to rise.

In the joy breathing isles of the blest;
Where the mighty of old have their home -
Where Achilles and Diomed rest.
In fresh myrtle my blade I'll entwine,
Like Harmodious, the gallant and good,
When he made at the tutelar shrine
A libation of Tyranny's blood.

Endless ages shall cherish your fame
Embalmed in their echoing songs!

Hymn To Lucifer 

Ware, nor of good nor ill, what aim hath act?
Without its climax, death, what savour hath
Life? an impeccable machine, exact
He paces an inane and pointless path
To glut brute appetites, his sole content
How tedious were he fit to comprehend
Himself! More, this our noble element
Of fire in nature, love in spirit, unkenned
Life hath no spring, no axle, and no end.
His body a bloody-ruby radiant
With noble passion, sun-souled Lucifer
Swept through the dawn colossal, swift aslant
On Eden's imbecile perimeter.
He blessed nonentity with every curse
And spiced with sorrow the dull soul of sense,
Breathed life into the sterile universe,
With Love and Knowledge drove out innocence
The Key of Joy is disobedience.

Thy faithfulness, Lord, Each moment we find,
So true to thy word, So loving and kind!
Thy mercy so tender To all the lost race,
The vilest offender May turn and find grace.
The mercy I feel To others I show,
I set to my seal That Jesus is true:
Ye all may find favour Who come at his call,
O come to my Saviour, His grace is for all!
To save what was lost, from heaven he came;
Come, sinners, and trust In Jesus's name.
He offers you pardon; He bids you be free;
"If sin be your burden, O come unto me!"
O let me commend My Saviour to you,
The publican's friend And Advocate too,
For you he is pleading His merits and death,
With God interceding for sinners beneath.
Then let us submit His grace to receive,
Fall down at his feet And gladly believe:
We all are forgiven For Jesus's sake:
Our title to heaven His merits we take.

The Fairy Bridal Hymn 

[This is the hymn to Eleanor, daughter of Mab and a golden d
rone, sung by the Locust choir when the fairy child marries her God, the yellow rose]
This is a song to the white-armed one
Cold in the breast as the frost-wrapped Spring,
Whose feet are slow on the hills of life,
Whose round mouth rules by whispering.
This is a song to the white-armed one
Whose breast shall burn as a Summer field,
Whose wings shall rise to the doors of gold,
Whose poppy lips to the God shall yield.
This is a song to the white-armed one
When the closing rose shall bind her fast,
And a song of the song their blood shall sing,
When the Rose-God drinks her soul at last.

The Old Battered Hymn Book 

There on the shelf lies the leather bound hymn book,
Once taken to chapel on each Sunday morn,
For so many years it had served a great purpose
But now it lies faded, so battered and worn.
The pages been turned many times many searches,
For dog-eared and creased by those kind Christian hands,
Whose voices sang out in the praise of our Saviour,
And rang through the hills of these once sacred lands.
Yet now almost silent as churches lie empty,
Demolished, converted or left boarded up,
And hiding the stained-glass that once let in sunlight,
Who now to taste the sweet wine from the cup?
When this hymn book was new I know things were so different,
I wish we'd return to those times long before,
As cast now aside on that dusty old bookcase,
Once valued and cherished but not anymore.
I look at the words written down through the ages,
They still carry meaning from which we should learn,
And each seems to stir a deep passion within me,
I long for the day that my Lord shall return.

Inside of me which runs wild

Switch on the power of imagination
But no image I get

No vehicle, no tenor I get

Just Another Imagery 

There were cold needles in my head
Silently wringing down my neck
Then there was a sudden shift
of rain to a sunny day
of shame to love
I was running in a meadow
You're meeting me there
I fall into your arms
Saw a mango tree
Your name I carved
Then bang my head
I gotta wake up.

Poem Start
Lack Of Imagery 

The stark difference between rich and poor
Has its serious takers in India than Europe and North America
But poor fellows along with poets
Do not have images to show off
So writings after writings come out
But none of them get any success,
poor remains poor
Rich gets richer widening chasm more
Literature does not have effects upon politics
And politicians do not understand literature
Culprit is not resources or intention
It is for the poor fellow writers who fails to portray vivid images.

Landscape Of Imagery Through Rhythms 

Playing with melodies and their rhythms in this poetical mind,
feeling joyful and free in the midst of nature while sitting
outside in a landscape filled with imagery.
Writing it all down, translating it from memories and experiences,
a little bit of happiness and joy settled within as everything is
compiled into poetry and prose.
A sincere and truthful way to express the experience of this
temporary life on earth, giving rise to thoughts coming from
every direction.

Let The Perfect Mirror Refrain Imagery 

I have done well
Then before mirror I have stood
Mirror has reflected well;

Mirror has reflected ill;
It is the perfect mirror
Praises who are really good and
Calls the ill to correct error.

Let this imagery speak!

But, let this imagery speak.

With the chain of life;
But, let this imagery speak to the sounds of nature.
Unspoiled beauty,
Your colours run deep! ! !

In a trance,
Seeing flamingoes dancing in paradise

Live Imagery 

My fancied escape on a time lone,
When the wind has refrained from its moan
To become at night, the sleepy drone.
Mind's ranging eye comes on like a phone
Transmission, or a silver beamed cone.
Live imagery on brain's screen is thrown
Like Safari full of wildness known,
Where limbs and wings all in splendour shown;
Figures playing in brightness I tone
Up in thought, which to delight is prone;
In me how passion cloud-high has grown,
The air-immense thrill it invites blown
To the pinnacle, the mount does own.
The exotics to treasure are sown
As pearls of peace in me to be flown;
Hunting I 'am in fantasy's zone
Of scenes wild, which beam beauty I hone
As words penned like a polished-prized stone.

Love Of Imagery 

Slippery, sliding down canyon walls, viewing every
minute detail on the way down.
Being excited and happy as life takes off before me,
wondering and having a love of imagery in sight.
Touching and releasing significant particles of
intellect into coded mysteries within rhythm.
Exercising and finding answers that are created from
innate knowledge.
Knowing that I can equate the equations of various
impossibilities with an accuracy beyond intellect.
Dreaming of incessant fibers that are needed to be
attached to molecules that are dancing to rhythms.

A Kyrielle Of Faith 

Though all seems wrong within your life
And the light seems soon to depart
And though pain may cut like a knife
Trust in the Lord with all your heart
Donâ€™t fear deceitful winds of change
Or think of those whom youâ€™re apart
When itâ€™s steep on that mountain range
Trust in the Lord with all your heart
Does He not feed birds of the air?
Or clothes to the lilies impart?
How much more does He care for you?
Trust in the Lord with all your heart
Though all seems wrong within your life
Trust in the Lord with all your heart

You do know all things in my heart:
I cannot beg for charity.
Oh, my God, have mercy for me.
In my country there is unrest
fire that set mere men to the test
and men are full of iniquity.
Oh, my God, have mercy for me.
Against darkness I cannot win,
I want to confess all my sin:

Hair long and fair and eyes without sight
Wailing so loud it will make your heart flee
You have heard the cry of the bean-sidhe
Gliding through out the forest at night
Lamenting a song of an unfortuitous plight
She will not leave, no matter your plea

But the next thing I heard was one lump or two
And he smiled most wide with his eyes all agleam
Never say yes when a dragon invites you to tea
His teeth were all pointy, as long as my shoe
And with a smile like that, who was I to refuse
So I smiled as I stammered 'can I have three? '

Inconceivable thoughts wonâ€™t flee
Invisible me you donâ€™t see
Suspicion soon grows then imparts
Leaving behind a bleeding heart

But neglects to tell you they'll use you as prey
And it is so easy to fall to his charismatic command
It doesn't pay to wear red when your on an 'Away'

No hellos, goodbyes, just left to guess
Boldly go where dreams just take us.
So much take place, things of all kind
Some things are better left behind
Good or bad then why make a fuss
Boldly go where dreams just take us.

Kyrielle For Some Sad Victims Of Racism 

When those  victims of racism are cruelly abused,
Their faces look so sad and they don't know they are used.
A fear of things makes them inept to protect their space.
Sometimes, they die in search for another dwelling place.
The crisis and the wars made these people immigrants.
Discriminated, blacks and whites look so innocent.
Their Stolen Generation grows and lives in disgrace.
Sometimes, they die in search for another dwelling place.
They need equality and peace in this world to live
And they pray to have the mercy and love our Lord can give.
To protest in the streets, they run their life steeplechase.
Sometimes, they die in search for another dwelling place.

Kyrielle Pardon Me Too 

Tormented in Hellâ€”who can tell
Of anguish sinners know so well
Smoldering souls, tortured of mind,
My Lord: be forgiving and kind.
Whole bodies on fireâ€”seized your word
In corners where nobody heard
Good News preached to those left behind,
My Lord: be forgiving and kind.
Pain wheedled tearsâ€”a heavy eye
Twists soft hearts drenched to dry
Unreasonable, spoiled, and blind,
My Lord: be forgiving and kind.
Uncomfortableâ€”unexpected,
Vacantâ€”emotionally dead;
Pitch pitiful thoughts toward mankind,
My Lord: be forgiving and kind.
I pound upon my swollen chest,
Thrust my arms over all the rest,
Beseech blessings that loop and bind,
My Lord: be forgiving and kind.

Kyrielle Sonnet An Angry Girl Child 

A girl-child walks along railroad;
Someone has hurt her feelings much;
Her mind is anguished by some word;
She needs a fairy-motherâ€™s touch!
Sheâ€™s unaware of dangers nigh;
No one can know her hurt as such!
May be, she thought she ought to die;
She needs a fairy-motherâ€™s touch!
In innocence, she treads this way;
Her mother loves her very much;
Her mom had spoken tough that day;
She needs a fairy-motherâ€™s touch!
A girl-child walks along railroad;
She needs a fairy-motherâ€™s touch!

Kyrielle Sonnet For George Sand And Fr+¬d+¬ric Chopin 

Searching for their love ideal
To plant there a dawn so real,
God gave them hope to go ahead
And palm flowers for their dream bed.
In their naked room without windows,
Not touched by the innuendos,
Music was their way to be wed
And palm flowers had their dream bed,
The cradle of their nascent thought
Could cut their main Gordian knot-
Baptism of freedom in the head.
Then, palm flowers had their dream bed.
Searching for their love ideal
And palm flowers for their dream bed.

Kyrielle Sonnet From Winter To Spring 

Alas! When winter left the world so bare,
with trees and plants denied of their welfare,
the birds begged God to change the sordid scene:
Spring sprung a surprise making landscape green!
God heard the prayers of all earthlings fast;
His heart with pity for them was soon cast;
The Maker could no longer stay so mean:
Spring sprung a surprise making landscape green!
Godâ€™s word returned the warmth and leaves in days,
with flowers, fruits birds, insects joining the race;
The earth got hope in form of verdure sheen;
Spring sprung a surprise making landscape green!
Alas! When winter left the world so bare,
Spring sprung a surprise making landscape green.

Life Kyrielle 

There are good days and some bad days
Life brings troubles gives us bad cards
But God in the end sees us through
Life gets hard and some lose their home
Times changing and sometimes go bad
Money's tight and no place to roam
Some lose jobs and they become sad
Life gets hard and some lose their home
Folks lose their health peace and sleep
Prices rise so high and jobs get low
Some need their home to live and keep
Life gets hard and some lose their home.

Life Treasures Kyrielle Poem 

Genuine friendship is a treasure
Of far greater worth than pure gold,
Through passing years the bond endures
Time and distance can't turn it cold.
Genuine friendship is a treasure
Built in trust, affection, and care -
The utmost good it will assure
Through changing seasons, it is there.
Genuine friendship is a treasure
Makes life's journey so fulfilling,
It comforts us, in sorrows, cure -
Finding it is a rare blessing!

Love Again Kyrielle Poem 

Sometimes Life gives a crushing blow
That leaves one numbed from all the pain.
Thoughts are swayed to stay or go -
Whether to find new love again.
Lessons are marked and truly deep
Thoughts remind of love forsaken.
Fears may bar new paths to keep -
Whether to find new love again.
But like the new day, Hope rises,
It may not be true for all men,
Someone may come, the choice changes -
Whether to find new love again.

Of Ganga for you under earth
Or you grow of a heavenly shoot
Tell me how this bright with all mirth

People Are Strange Kyrielle Poem 

People are strange, of varied moods
Some have loads of unresolved past.
Careless words are misunderstood,
When sorry is said, forgive we must.
People are strange, of varied moods
Childhood scars and fears suffocate
Harmony in life and stifle the Good,
And Conflict grows until it's too late.
People are strange, of varied moods
None are the same though they be twins,
Let's then show our love as we should
Strange we may be, everyone wins!

Poetry And My Sewing Kyrielle 

When I was young and in my prime
I was just an ugly duckling.
I'd stay at home and spend my time
With poetry and my sewing.
Hours were gold in this noble craft
I found joy in creating something,
No parties for me, I thrived enough
With poetry and my sewing.
No late night's drain, my health was good
I got bored with all the dancing,
This wall flower bloomed as I should

None of my poems fit the bill.
I'll write a new one.  What the hell.
I need another kyrielle.
I must not mention politics
Or religion.  I'm in a fix.
A sonnet - that's all very well.
I need another kyrielle
I can't go on about my weight,
Be negative, or full of hate.
Won't settle for a villanelle.
I need another kyrielle.
I mustn't moan about the shrinks,
Or point out that the "system" stinks.
The truth remains, but I won't tell.
Just need another kyrielle.
Won't criticise my CPN.
Oh dear, I must put down my pen.
Must write a new one.  What the hell.

Sandcastles In The Rain A Kyrielle 

Child, one day you will understand
When the course of time eases the pain
Giving way to all life's earthly demands
Your tears will fade like sandcastles in the rain
When all your bitter sorrows depart
And all that remains is the shadow of pain
Love will be the memory you hold in your heart
Your tears will fade like sandcastles in the rain
Hopes and dreams of love will reign anew
Where those memories of pain had once lain
And once more your heart will shine true
Your tears will fade like sandcastles in the rain
Child, one day you will understand
Your tears will fade like sandcastles in the rain

Siachen A Kyrielle Sonnet 

At the savage, indigo sky,
draped in snow, claw the mountains high.
By the cirque, a base, sheltered 'neath,
his gun sings the ballad of death.
A field of kash, in autumn swirl,
the dark braid of that village girl.
Mother's white, unwavering faith,
his gun sings the ballad of death.
Skin burns through the synthetic girth,
frozen blood inseminates earth.
Echo of loss shudders his breath,
his gun sings the ballad of death.
At the savage, indigo sky,
his gun sings the ballad of death.

Thats Why Kyrielle 

Your attitude is really bad
and you are indeed not my friend
You're not to me at all that's sad
That's why chosen to keep away
For long I thought you a true friend
all can do is for you to pray
My heart needs time to heal and mend
That's why chosen to keep away
But got Jesus, He makes heart sing
Can't help to love and care a lot
But wearing mask is not my thing
That's why chosen to keep away
I don't want to get hurt anymore
you do your thing and thats your right
but don't like your game I close door
That's why chosen to keep away.

It all gets explained with two eyes,
All the reasons we give with words
Cannot fathom the depth nor highs,
The whys and passions so expressed.
Some are blue, some are green or brown,
They share so much, rest assured,
Having it all, yet still they frown
With whys and passions so expressed.
The look of you is more than shared,
It is a puzzle that's explained
When you see into pools of care,
The whys and passions so expressed.

In this our brief earthly journey
Men face pain, conflict, wars and strife.

Hate that cuts and kills like a knife.
We failed to learn our lessons here-

For in Man's heart, Darkness is rife.

If we hold on to His teaching,
Remain in Christ and stay humble,

If we do love one another
And this love is seen by people,
They'll know we bear as followers
The marks of a true disciple.
As branches live with the true Vine,
Without Him we are not able
To bear fruit which truly define
The marks of a true disciple.
To the world as we testify
Who God is and share the Gospel,
His Seed is sown and multiply
The marks of a true disciple.

This Day What Future Will It Bring Kyrielle Sonnet 

This day what future will it bring.
What songs will we finally sing?
Snow quietly gracing the ground.
There will then come a silent sound.
We will be skating on the pond
And ev'ry one will form a bond.
By crackling fire we'll gather round.
There will then be a silent sound.
No recipe will we follow
Flitting the night with the swallows.
We'll form a ring around, around.
There will then come a silent sound.
This day what future will it bring.
There will then come a silent sound.

A Kyrielle Sonnet consists of 14 lines (three rhyming quatra
in stanzas and a non-rhyming couplet) .   Just like the tra
ditional Kyrielle poem, the Kyrielle Sonnet also has a repe
ating line or phrase as a refrain (usually appearing  as th
e last line of each stanza) . Each line within the Kyrielle
 Sonnet consists of only eight syllables. French poetry for
ms have a tendency to link back to the beginning of the poe
m, so common practice is to use the first and last line of 
the first quatrain as the ending couplet. This would also r
e-enforce the refrain within the poem. Therefore, a good rh
yming scheme for a Kyrielle Sonnet would be:               AabB, ccbB, ddbB, AB -or- AbaB, cbcB, dbdB, AB.

Wealth Kyrielle 

I had a friend so blessed with wealth,
Owned a house and vast properties,
She had one brother of poor health,
Brain damaged with lost memories.
I had a cousin blessed with wealth,
Loved money so much won't spend it,
Held it like ice cream, watched it melt-
And the joy of life he'd forfeit.
I had an aunt so blessed with wealth,
Her heart was cold and uncaring.
Money seemed to numb all she felt,
It prevented her from loving.
I may not be quite blessed with wealth
But God gave me more than just things.
Through all my joys and tears He held
This life - I'm thankful for living.

When Anger Plagues The Heart Kyrielle 

When anger plagues the heart it seems
The words we say hurt so much more.
Tempers may fly, break at the seams,
As we try to even the score.
When anger plagues the heart it seems
We forget the good times we had.
We dump the joys, the hopes, and dreams,
And just magnify all the bad.
When anger plagues the heart it seems
We tend to inflict useless pain.
But after the fight, some light beams
Just like the sun shines after rain.

was finished his tools had to be clean, because he was the boss
of a slap happy working team.They would put in the footings
then forget to build the wall and when they did it was
neither short or tall.They once built an house with an
extention on the side it was that badly built that no one could reside.
He had a young apprentice who soon became his hoddie,
he never let him lay the bricks because his work was always
shoddy.There were a couple of muckers who mixed
up the cement they were for ever subbing
so they never paid their rent.His labourers name was
Dodger who would work now and then, most of the time
was spent at The Bookies placing bets for other men.
He employed an incompetent plumber who always gave
him the pip, every job he went on he always left a drip.
He was a good Bricky I would say he was first class, but when it
came to team work they were just total 'Arse'

We were district champions and that was no dream.
They looked so sharp in their brand new clothes,
They knew their cases and prepared their briefs,
They were ready to win.
As the day dragged on and on,
My opinion changed ever so small.
Winning soon went out of the pictures,
However, what I learned,
Winning wasn't everything.
The need to win took second place,
My students learned what is was to be successful, You see that taught me!
I learned when the student said, ' Oh, coach, don't
Be mad, we tried our best and next year,
We will get them not worry! '

Rend ye the delicate-woven vest!
Let the wail ring wild and high:

Of Kypris â€” after such day as this?
'Oh Adonis, thou leavest me â€” woe for my lot!
And Eros, my servant, availeth me not!'
So wails Cytherea, grief-distraught.

Not Ares my god-lover, passionate one
Who sware in his jealousy forth to hale
Hephaestus my spouse from his palace, if he
Dared but to lift his eyes unto me.
Not he can console me, Adonis, for thee!'

Words, words, words dancing in my head,
It usually happens when I've just gone to bed,
They toss around til I can no longer sleep;
And my thoughts become crowded when in those words creep;
So up I get to pen them down,
Sometimes they even cause me  to wear a frown,
It's like a curse that  haunts & plays with my mind,
But once complete my poems do leave me  joy behind;
So onward the words begin to grow with a definite flow;
And then  I can only hope it makes me a better poet as I go.

Girls Lament 

In the years when we were
all children, this inclining
to be alone so much was gentle;
others' time passed fighting,
and one had one's faction,
one's near, one's far-off place,
a path, an animal, a picture.
And I still imagined, that life
would always keep providing
for one to dwell on things within,
Am I within myself not in what's greatest?
Shall what's mine no longer soothe
and understand me as a child?
Suddenly I'm as if cast out,
and this solitude surrounds me
as something vast and unbounded,
when my feeling, standing on the hills
of my breasts, cries out for wings
or for an end.

Desolate and forsaken!
The stranger's arm hath seized thy brand,
Thou art bowed beneath the stranger's hand,
And the stranger thy birthright hath taken.
Where is the mark of thy chosen race?
Infamous and degraded!
It hath fallen on thee, on thy dwelling-place,
And that heaven-stamped sign to a foul disgrace
And the scoff of the world, has faded.
First-born of nations! upon thy brow,
Resistless and revenging,
The fiery finger of God hath now
Written the sentence of thy woe,
The innocent blood avenging!
Lion of Judah! thy glory is past,
Vanished and fled for ever.
Homeless and scattered, thy race is cast
Like chaff in the breath of the sweeping blast,
To rally or rise again, never!

Lament For The Poets1916 

I heard the Poor Old Woman say:
"At break of day the fowler came,
And took my blackbirds from their songs
Who loved me well thro' shame and blame
No more from lovely distances
Their songs shall bless me mile by mile,
Nor to white Ashbourne call me down
To wear my crown another while.
With bended flowers the angels mark
For the skylark the place they lie,
From there its little family
Shall dip their wings first in the sky.
And when the first suprise of flight
Sweet songs excite, from the far dawn
Shall there come blackbirds loud with love,
Sweet echoesmof the singers gone.
But in the lovely hush of eve
Weeping I grieve the silent bills"
I heard the Poor Old Woman say
In Derry of the little hills.

Lament For The Two Brothers Slain By Each Others Hand 

Now do our eyes behold
The tidings which were told:
Twin fallen kings, twin perished hopes to mourn,
The slayer, the slain,
The entangled doom forlorn
And ruinous end of twain.
Say, is not sorrow, is not sorrow's sum
On home and hearthstone come?
Oh, waft with sighs the sail from shore,
Oh, smite the bosom, cadencing the oar
That rows beyond the rueful stream for aye
To the far strand,
The ship of souls, the dark,
The unreturning bark
Whereon light never falls nor foot of Day,
Even to the bourne of all, to the unbeholden land.

Lament For Thomas Mcdonagh 

He shall not hear the bittern cry
In the wild sky, where he is lain,
Nor voices of the sweeter birds,
Above the wailing of the rain.
Nor shall he know when loud March blows
Thro' slanting snows her fanfare shrill,
Blowing to flame the golden cup
Of many an upset daffodil.
But when the Dark Cow leaves the moor
And pastures poor with greedy weeds
Perhaps he'll hear her low at morn
Lifting her horn in pleasant meads.

Lament In Silence 

I could have moved him
If he could hear how loud
my heart was beating
I could have touched him
But he could not feel much
beyond his pale skin
I could have loved him
But he was blind and could not read
my broken lines
I went through the motions
Drowning in an ocean
A dead sea...
He kept on looking past me

Lament Of An Icarus 

Lovers of whores donâ€™t care,
happy, calm and replete:
But my arms are incomplete,
grasping the empty air.
Thanks to stars, incomparable ones,
that blaze in the depths of the skies,
all my destroyed eyes
see, are the memories of suns.
I look, in vain, for beginning and end
of the heavensâ€™ slow revolve:
Under an unknown eye of fire, I ascend
feeling my wings dissolve.
And, scorched by desire for the beautiful,
I will not know the bliss,
of giving my name to that abyss,
that knows my tomb and funeral.

Lament 

WHEN you hear the white-throat pealing
From a tree-top far away,
And the hills are touched with purple
At the borders of the day;
When the redwing sounds his whistle
At the coming on of spring,
And the joyous April pipers
Make the alder marshes ring;
When the wild new breath of being
Whispers to the World once more,
And before the shrine of beauty
Every spirit must adore;
When long thoughts come back with twilight,
And a tender deepened mood
Shows the eyes of the beloved
Like hepaticas in the wood;
Ah, remember, when to nothing
Save to love your heart gives heed,
And spring takes you to her bosom,â€”
So it was with Golden Weed!

Lament 

Sleep and death, the dusky eagles
Around this head swoop all night long;
Eternityâ€™s icy wave
Would swallow the golden image
Of man; against horrible reefs
His purple body is shattered.
And the dark voice laments
Over the sea.
Sister of stormy sadness,
Look a timid dinghy goes down
Under stars,
The silent face of the night.

Lament 

Where are those dazzling hills touched by the sun,
Those crags in childhood that I used to climb?
Hidden, hidden under mist is yonder mountain,
Hidden is the heart.
A day of cloud, a lifetime falls between,
Gone are the heather moors and the pure stream,
Gone are the rocky places and the green,
Hidden, hidden under sorrow is yonder mountain,
Hidden, hidden.
O storm and gale of tears, whose blinding screen
Makes weather of grief, snow's drifting curtain
Palls th'immortal heights once seen.
Hidden, hidden is the heart,
Hidden, hidden is the heart.

Lament 

To the memory of my mother
And now she has over her head brown clouds of roots
a slim lily of salt on the temples beads of sand
while she sails on the bottom of a boat through foaming nebulas
a mile beyond us where the river turns
visible-invisible as the light on a wave
truly she isn't different-abandoned like all of us

Lament Whom Will You Cry To Heart 

Whom will you cry to, heart? More and more lonely,
your path struggles on through incomprehensible
mankind. All the more futile perhaps
for keeping to its direction,
keeping on toward the future,
toward what has been lost.
Once. You lamented? What was it? A fallen berry
of jubilation, unripe.
But now the whole tree of my jubilation
is breaking, in the storm it is breaking, my slow
tree of joy.
Loveliest in my invisible
landscape, you that made me more known
to the invisible angels.
Translated by Stephen Mitchell

All on that charming coast is no bitter snow and frost,

There streams for ever flow, and there flowers for ever blow,
And alas! I am weary, weary O!

None. I see. The tomcats tore off your balls? (1)
Come kiss me, she says. Don't be afraid
No. I am afraid of your mom's murghabis, her cHitters (2)
Making love to an old man is like
fucking a wrinkled, dry, molded stalk of corn (3)

murghabi = fashionable, expensive Punjabi women's footwear
cHitters = a pair of sandals, shoes
Henna shows its color when crushed on a stone
I will crush you making love till you moan (4)
You reject her - her eyes like cat's, on her head a wig
And you - body of an elephant, face of a pig! (5)

All Day She Quiet Lay 

All day she quiet lay, lost in a trance,
The closing shadows all of her embracing...
The madcap rain of summer frisked and pranced,
At leaves it drummed, down garden paths went racing.
And slowly, slowly she revived and sought
To hear its voice, its warm and merry patter.
Withdrawn she lay, plunged deep in conscious thought,
And listened to the rushing, singing water.
Then suddenly she sighed and spoke; I heard...
(I was alive, alive through force of habit)
The softly whispered, simple, broken words:
"O how I loved it all, O how I loved it!"
You loved... To love so well none ever durst...
Then, even such love fades, to be it ceases...
To watch you die, and live! How did my heart not burst,
Not break, O God, into a thousand pieces!

As I Lay With Head In Your Lap Camerado 

AS I lay with my head in your lap, Camerado,
The confession I made I resume--what I said to you in the open air I
resume:
I know I am restless, and make others so;
I know my words are weapons, full of danger, full of death;
(Indeed I am myself the real soldier;
It is not he, there, with his bayonet, and not the red-striped
artilleryman;)
For I confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to unsettle
them;
I am more resolute because all have denied me, than I could ever have
been had all accepted me;
I heed not, and have never heeded, either experience, cautions,
majorities, nor ridicule;
And the threat of what is call'd hell is little or nothing to me;  10
And the lure of what is call'd heaven is little or nothing to me;
...Dear camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and
still urge you, without the least idea what is our destination,
Or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell'd and defeated.

God Lay Dead In Heaven 

God lay dead in heaven;
Angels sang the hymn of the end;
Purple winds went moaning,
Their wings drip-dripping
With blood
That fell upon the earth.
It, groaning thing,
Turned black and sank.
Then from the far caverns
Of dead sins
Came monsters, livid with desire.
They fought,
Wrangled over the world,
A morsel.
But of all sadness this was sad -
A woman's arms tried to shield
The head of a sleeping man
From the jaws of the final beast.

I Dream D I Lay 

I dream'd I lay where flowers were springing
Gaily in the sunny beam;
List'ning to the wild birds singing,
By a falling crystal stream:
Straight the sky grew black and daring;
Thro' the woods the whirlwinds rave;
Tress with aged arms were warring,
O'er the swelling drumlie wave.
Such was my life's deceitful morning,
Such the pleasures I enjoyed:
But lang or noon, loud tempests storming
A' my flowery bliss destroy'd.
Tho' fickle fortune has deceiv'd me-
She promis'd fair, and perform'd but ill,
Of mony a joy and hope bereav'd me-
I bear a heart shall support me still.

Anâ€™ just quietly stepped aside,
I knew that guy would do you wrong
What he said was just old lies,
Could feel and see it
In those dark conniving eyes.

Let your feelings flow,

Shining diamond bright,
Close your eyes now darling

pretty ugly but otherwise sana.

They would never fit into a crate.
And when eaten in haste
for their wonderful taste
they'll go down, slightly bent, to their fate.
Each banana here has its own bender
they are twisted according to gender.
if a straight one slips through

and it always goes back to the sender.

O, what is the song this late, late rose is singing?
where will its petals fall, pale orange-yellow rose?
when shall the breeze and the rose cease laughing, dancing,
when will the raindrops bring time, and loss, and tears?
who wrote the song that the rose is singing, singing,
who painted petals on this fleeting rose?
when did the breeze discover dancing, dancing,
with roses that fade and fall in loss and time and tears?
after the rosefall, a colder  breeze is blowing,
rose petals lie in drifts upon the ground;
but the breeze remembers, wintering red rose-hips, sowing
the roseâ€™s spring and singing; remembering  roseâ€™s sound..

A Lyric To Mirth 

While the milder fates consent,
Let's enjoy our merriment :
Drink, and dance, and pipe, and play ;
Kiss our dollies night and day :
Crowned with clusters of the vine,
Let us sit, and quaff our wine.
Call on Bacchus, chant his praise ;
Shake the thyrse, and bite the bays :
Rouse Anacreon from the dead,
And return him drunk to bed :
Sing o'er Horace, for ere long
Death will come and mar the song :
Then shall Wilson and Gotiere
Never sing or play more here.

An Olde Lyric 

I.
Oh, saw ye my own true love, I praye,
My own true love so sweete?
For the flowers have lightly toss'd awaye
The prynte of her faery feete.
Now, how can we telle if she passed us bye?
Is she darke or fayre to see?
Like sloes are her eyes, or blue as the skies?
Is't braided her haire or free?
II.
Oh, never by outward looke or signe,
My true love shall ye knowe;
There be many as fayre, and many as fyne,
And many as brighte to showe.
But if ye coude looke with angel's eyes,
Which into the soule can see,
She then would be seene as the matchless Queene
Of Love and of Puritie.

A Parody On Euripidess Lyric Verse 

Halcyons ye by the flowing sea
Waves that warble twitteringly,
Circling over the tumbling blue,
Dipping your down in its briny dew,
Spi-i-iders in corners dim
Spi-spi-spinning your fairy film,
Shuttles echoing round the room
Silver notes of the whistling loom,
Where the light-footed dolphin skips
Down the wake of the dark-prowed ships,
Over the course of the racing steed
Where the clustering tendrils breed
Grapes to drown dull care in delight,
Oh! mother make me a child again just for to-night!
I don't exactly see how that last line is to scan,
But that's a consideration I leave to our musical man.

One time more in their tiding's turning ways

One, two, three, but nobody knows for sure
Whether a life is all new or out worn
The ocean is deep in its true abyss
And nothing comes back to tell the truth

The rest is unknown in its eternal youth
Come here and give your inspiration's find

Tongue in my cheek and so tough
Keep myself uncanny

I Feel Colours In Poems A Lyric 

I feel colours in poems
Not only words
I feel me there too
And animals and birds
It's a wood deep and evergreen
Not all understood or seen
Sometimes brighter then a morning
Or emotional deeper than an yearning
It's sometimes everything
Then nothing in between
I feel colours in poems
Sure it's all language
But it's this and this too
Always something new
I have seen a tree poem
I have seen a mountain poem
And all the other poems
I nearly understood
I am like a little poem
Just like you

I Hold You In The Lyric Of My Thoughts 

In memory of Menke Katz
I hold you in the lyric of my thoughts.
No, never mind that mist that hurts the eyes.
Tomorrow in Jerusalem, my friend,
Our dance beguiles the autumn of its grief.
I have you still with all my treasures kept,
Poor scribbles and the pencil-colored flowers.
Write me new letters on the windowpane.
Sign them as always with your shadow name.
Frost memories give me courage for today.
Just taste October with me, find it good.
The time is poignant like a Yiddish tune,
As bittersweet and smoky as old leaves.

Love Lyric 

What is love?
love is a word
It is also devotion
It is pleasure, passion,

Love knows no limits
Love is perfect, it is attachment
Love is special, it is heavenly
it is kind, sympathetic.
Love is joy, reason, feeling, sacrifice and serving
Love is to care
Love keeps back all things
Love brings love
Love is a great gift
Without love there is no life; loving is living
Living is to walk the earth,
be alive see the light.

Lyric Written In1830 

What means my name to you?...T'will die
As does the melancholy murmur
Of distant waves or, of a summer,
The forest's hushed nocturnal sigh.
Found on a fading album page,
Dim will it seem and enigmatic,
Like words traced on a tomb, a relic
Of some long dead and vanished age.
What's in my name?...Long since forgot,
Erased by new, tempestuous passion,
of tenderness 'twill leave you not
The lingering and sweet impression.
But in an hour of agony,
Pray, speak it, and recall my image,
And say, "He still remembers me,
His heart alone still pays me homage."

Fades the rosy tender
Evening light;
Then in starry splendor
Comes the night.
So a stormy lifetime
Comes to close,
Spirit's mortal strifetime
Finds repose.
Faith and toil and vision
Crowned at last,
Failure and derision
Overpast,â€”
All the daylight splendor
Far above,
Calm and sure and tender
Comes thy love.

The Lyric Of Infinite Life 

The soft and cold flowing wind
Dancing beautifully leafs of trees,
When it rains happily
River and waterfall also flowing with delight.
See sweet dream of being victorious
The river water flowing as I go,
Restless feet walk forward I go
The mysterious world of sweet song in the vortex.
In the rainy season clouds cry
Thus the rain is to fall from the sky heavily,
The winter season dew sing songs
The dream of sun rise in the east.
Rose flower calls to the butterflies
Feathers fly diffuse to move the butterflies,
The song of infinite life sing the world
New moon, at the edge of new sun.
The longest and far life to the road
Here I am traveling and traveling to,
Rainy wind kisses on my cheeks
For the trip now I don't want to cry.

The Lyric Rose 

What other work in the world have I
Than but to sing my song, and die?
No other work of hate or love
For hell below or heaven above!
As if it were the one thing true
For me, whatever others do,
My days and nights to this tune set
As Romeo to Juliet,
I put all else within time by;
For this do live â€” for this would die,
If that but haply on my tomb
A lyric rose should bud and bloom,
The which some passer-by might swear
Was precious in its beauty there,
And, kneeling, might a petal take
And love it for the Singer's sake!
A Girl's Desire.

Today is here, tomorrow might not come,
Let us kiss with lips, blazing hot with fire,
Keep me glowing red, burning with desire;
Surely now will I, to your wiles succumb,
My flesh will, to passion of yours aspire,
Today is here, tomorrow might not come,
Let us kiss with lips, blazing hot with fire;
Or give me Hell, if Heaven is to come,
Or drag me along thorns,  midden or mire,
If I, soon after, would solace acquire,
Today is here, tomorrow might not come,

Keep me glowing red, burning with desire.

Nectaria, sweet, cry not yourself to sleep
I came to sing for you this lullaby
Oft sang by angels, wherever they fly
No cause is there for you to ever weep
I said goodnight, but never once goodbye
Nectaria, sweet, cry not yourself to sleep
I came to sing for you this lullaby
Your cheeks I kissed while you have slept so deep
Your dreams have risen higher than the sky
And when you wake up, I will tell you why
Why you need never cry yourself to sleep
For I will sing for you this lullaby
Oft sang by angels wherever they fly

O sweet Nectaria, keep a song to sing.
And fill your mind with thoughts that make you sigh,
Your heart, with hopes that sooner rise sky high.
Should August's stormy days, their strong winds bring,
Dark clouds that often hide the sun and sky,
Love finds you once you keep a song to sing,
And fill your mind with thoughts that make you sigh.
When Autumn leaves but one leaf left to cling,
And songbirds search for nests where else to fly,
Think not this moment as a time to cry.
But mark, to always keep a song to sing
And fill your mind with thoughts that make you sigh,
Your heart, with hopes that sooner  rise sky high.

When came puppy love, and I felt aghast
Waking up to find, sixteen came too fast;
With lashes that curl, and shades on your lids
Oh so different, when I saw you last
Seems just yesterday, when we fought as kids
When came puppy love, and I felt aghast
Goodbye now to dolls, as your lipstick bids
Goodbye lollipops, pigtails of the past
Sultry now you look, coming with a blast
When just yesterday, we have fought as kids
When came puppy love, and I felt aghast
Waking up to find, sixteen came too fast.

In a small cottage, by a wind-swept shore,
Lives my fair sweetheart, that I left behind,
And though far away, is still on my mind;
And I know my heart could not ask for more,
Than the care and love, I could always find,
In a small cottage, by the wind-swept shore,
There with my sweetheart, that I left behind;
When my thoughts wander, to the times before,
To those memories of which I'm not blind,
I won't ever find a  love of such kind,
As in small cottage, by the wind-swept shore,
With my fair sweetheart, that I left behind,
Which though far away, is still on my mind.

Moon can wane, stars can dim, and sun can set,
But mark, they always hold on to the sky,
As dreams may fade, but hopes can never die;
Love sometimes change, hearts also may forget,
For dreams are hard to hold, though hard you try,
Your moon could wane, stars dim, and sun could set,
So best, to always hold on to the sky;
And look upwards, with no pain or regret,
But do not try to find the reasons why,
For life proceeds, by ways none can deny,
Moon can wane, stars can dim, and sun can set,
So mark, to always hold on to the sky,
As dreams may fade, but hopes can never die.

When very real everything then seems,
Like hints of love imparted by your touch,
Exciting me to wistful sweet extremes;
Yet omens and stars augur not so much

That flee the mournful mists
To find, in the heaven of thy soul,

Of all the fugitive flowerings.

But ever their fragrant lives
Mount toward the altar of thy heart
In a soft and heatless air
Where indolent clouds are bom.

Sung on a clouded evening,
That mount among the petals
Of pale and perfumed roses
Falling at thy shadowy shutters.

In their live together
With its thought and weigh
Making pleasance better
So much of in care
Bringing summer in
Letting love be there
In its passionâ€™s spin
Adour is at times stripped
So much full of nothing
In its thinking whipped
With it much of bluffing

Giving some of aching
Make it not worth try
In its provoke waking

What we can then tame
In stronger loveâ€™s grounding
And its brighter flame

Youth is full of sports,
Age's breath is short,
Youth is nimble, Age is lame:
Youth is hot and bold,
Age is weak and cold,
Youth is wild, and Age is tame:-

The sun shines fair on Tweedside, the river flowing bright,
Your heart is full of pleasure, your eyes are full of light,
Your cheeks are like the morning, your pearls are like the dew,
Or morning and her dew-drops are like your pearls and you.
Because you are a princess, a princess of the land,
You will not turn your lightsome eyes a moment where I stand,
A poor unnoticed poet, a-making of his rhymes;
But I have found a mistress, more fair a thousand times.
`Tis May, the elfish maiden, the daughter of the Spring,
Upon whose birthday morning the birds delight to sing.
They would not sing one note for you, if you should so command,
Although you are a princess, a princess of the land.

Unlock the heavy bolts of the prison doors
Free this beauty who was violent only one time
A crime of passion it was
that went too far in the throes of self-preservation
Free her to carry her atonement outside prison walls
Free her to educate us in the ways of frightened, victimized women
Free her to share her wisdom from years of traumas and trials
Free her to expand her artwork
Those colors and expressions
she brings to perfection

An artist she is and was from birth
Free her
Unlock the heavy bolts of the prison doors
Free her to seize a bright NEW DAY!

Madrigal For Mirabel 

Never again would I relegate the pearl found in the black conclave
To the dark depths of the abysm of time
Never again would I rant and rave hurling infernal profanities
At the dispenser of my delusion
Long lost in the hurly-burly of illusion
Tossing and turning whirling in labyrinths of doubts
Irreligion and arrant agnosticism was surging in my veins
I desecrated your altar of love reducing the gods of passion to mere playthings
On the unloved waves of life I billowed until your queenly fleet appeared
And that night of nights you became the stiller of the demented storm in my life
It was a miracle meeting you Mirabel
I will walk to the altar of love in triumph to be shielded in the benignity
Of your incomparable generosity
Your beauty a cloak for my demented filth
O it is a miracle meeting you Mirabel

In your divided soul;
Nor you, that mine should not belong
Entire to one control.
Let simple lovers if they will
Contemn us, we outwit them still.
For small and poor and cold indeed

Hold but the measure of the need,
The joy, of any man.
Both spare and prodigal were we,
To love but you, to love but me.

He thrushes, he nightingales, 0 he's a lark.
He cuts the cinquefoil air into snippets
With his love's scissors in the shape of a stork.
Hear the alto's glissando, October.
She drapes blue air on her love's shoulders,
On his velvet jerkin the color of crows.
Her cape of felt & old pearls enfolds her.
How the baritone roots out in May!
His depths reach even the silence inside
The worms moving level, the worms moving up,
The pike plunging under the noisy tide.
Hear the soprano's vibrato, November,
Water surface trembles, cold in the troughs.
She transforms blowing hedges into fences,
She transforms scarlet leaves into moths.

Which by e'ery passing minute is born of thee,

it is six in the morning
I get down and move the car from
the place reserved for vans.
This the best of times cooling before the heat begins
only a few people out walking their dogs enjoying
the peace of a beginning.
I could have parked my car in the space between
two cars, but I lose my nerves, this after 60 years of driving.
in the night the wind blew hard from the sea
tiring itself out, and me too I hate the wind it takes my breath away
leaves me a husk falling asleep in front of the TV.
Yesterday I carried water to the house, the porter usually

Being able to carry bottles of water is better than not being

Madrigal 

LIKE the Idalian queen,
Her hair about her eyne,
With neck and breast's ripe apples to be seen,
At first glance of the morn
In Cyprus' gardens gathering those fair flow'rs
Which of her blood were born,
I saw, but fainting saw, my paramours.
The Graces naked danced about the place,
The winds and trees amazed
With silence on her gazed,
The flowers did smile, like those upon her face;
And as their aspen stalks those fingers band,
That she might read my case,
A hyacinth I wish'd me in her hand.
END

Madrigal Sur Un Carnet D Ivoire 

Mes vers, sur les lames dâ€™ivoire
De votre carnet, font semblant
Dâ€™imiter la floraison noire
Des cheveux sur votre cou blanc.
Il faudrait dâ€™immortelles strophes
A votre charme triomphal,
Quand dans un tourbillon dâ€™Ã©toffes
Vous entrez follement au bal.
Le sein palpite sous la gaze
Et, fermÃ©s Ã  demi, les yeux
Voilent leurs Ã©clairs de topaze
Sous la frange des cils soyeux.
Willis parisienne, empreinte
Dâ€™un charme inquiÃ©tant, mais doux,
Jâ€™attends, voluptueuse crainte,
La mort, si je valse avec vous.

Mystic Madrigal Moaning 

felon fingers fiddling
fostering rustic rhythm
saucy instrument puking
mystic madrigal moaning
airy atmosphere seconding
pruning pulsing feelings
punctured pleasure littered
in atmosphere shattered
hoisted happiness battered
coda crushed crest;
mystic melody melts
at desire's death
Yucks! fingers again
revived rotten refrain.

Sonnet Madrigal 

J'ai voulu des jardins pleins de roses fleuries,
J'ai rÃªvÃ© de l'Eden aux vivantes fÃ©eries,
De lacs bleus, d'horizons aux tons de pierreries;
Mais je ne veux plus rien ; il suffit que tu ries.
Car, roses et muguets, tes lÃ¨vres et tes dents
Plus que l'Eden, sont buts de dÃ©sirs imprudents,
Et tes yeux sont des lacs de saphir, et dedans
S'ouvrent des horizons sans fin, des cieux ardents.
Corps musquÃ©s sous la gaze oÃ¹ l'or lamÃ© s'Ã©tale,
Nefs, haschischâ€¦ j'ai rÃªvÃ© d'ivresse orientale.
Et mon rÃªve s'incarne en ta beautÃ© fatale.
Car, plus encor qu'en mes plus fantastiques vÅ“ux,
J'ai trouvÃ© de parfums dans l'or de tes cheveux,
D'ivresse Ã  m'entourer de tes beaux bras nerveux.
END

The Alienated Mistress A Madrigal From An Unfinished Melodrama 

Lady.
If Love be dead (and you aver it!)
Tell me, Bard! where Love lies buried.
Poet.
Love lies buried where 'twas born,
Ah, faithless nymph! think it no scorn
If in my fancy I presume
To name thy bosom poor Love's Tomb,
And on that Tomb to read the line,
Here lies a Love that once was mine,
But took a chill, as I divine,
And died at length of a decline.
END

The Second Madrigal 

A night of love
exquisite as a
concert from old Venice
played on exquisite instruments.
Healthy as a
buttock of a little angel.
Wise as an
anthill.
Garish as air
blown into a trumpet.
Abundant as the reign
of a royal Negro couple
seated on two thrones
cast in gold.
A night of love with you,
a big baroque battle
and two victories.

A Horse Of A Different Color In Black And White And Technicolor Narrative Satire 

Recently discovered an official White House report on the events that took place on
December 15,2009 Titled (Yellow brick road))        posted by Wikileaks.
The report exposed that there had been an accidental releasi
ng of an experiment virus at a Class 5 military research lab located in Oz Kansas.
The (Anti-M)  rouge virus upon inhalation temporally caused 
color blindness, and altered depth perception.  The White H
ouse declared a state of emergency for the entire State of 
Kansas ordering the closing of all public and private schools.
The National Guard had been activated, and President Barack Obama said 'It was for traffic control purposes.'
The following day Avatar premiered at theaters and received 
rave reviews all across the country, but not in Oz, where m
ovie goers were walking out in droves, demanding refunds. O
ne patron a member of the Lollypop Guild echoed the sentime
nts of the outraged crowd leaving the Toto Theater, he was 
quoted as saying. 'The greatest movie ever, when monkeys fly, it's the worst B movie I've ever seen.'
In light of the recently obtained Wikileaks information the 
producers of the movie, Avatar, have filed a class action law suit against the government in Federal Court
Pertaining to the large release of the color blind virus at Oz Kansas on Dec.15,09
Sighting that the movie maker's right to fool the public was infringed upon.
When asked about the movie, in a previously recorded intervi
ew, one of the producers gave this comment; 'We had the hea
rt and courage to make it all along, even though it's reall
y nothing more then a futuristic Cowboy, and Indian flick. 
 So, we spent a third world's yearly budget on special effe
cts.  When you add that much glitz, and glam to a dog, and pony show people will be convinced it's a night at the opera.'
The United States Government settled out of court earlier to
day with the producers of the movie Avatar, for an undisclo
sed amount of money.  A highly informed source inside the b
ubble (AKA Glinda)      reported that the amount could be i
n excess of $500 million dollars.  Pending that there will 
be no further appeal(s)     following the Yellow brick road
 incident, the Brains behind Avatar will be clicking their heels happily ever after.

A Narrative 

A giant tear rolls
on the face of moon
and intend to ask, why did you crave for
the thing which you
don't get.
And then you would
smile to match the burning
lakes in the eyes of the distant star.
A void was coming up in
strange rituals. How will you
make a temple of panacea?
The hysteria erupts
in a mud dance, to plant the
lotus seeds, kissing water of god.
Smokeless flames
rise from the nameless
fire of the savage embrace.
Forthrightly a poem was ready to be boon.

Angels Anticipations Narrative Imaginative 

Alone, under clouded skies and darkness;
An angel awaits her knight in gloom,
Her cloak of white laced, tinsels sparkle;
To the silvery outlined puffed up moon.
Her delicate wings of satins finest silk;
Displayed like white winter plumage,
Her curled and lengthy golden locks;
Floats across her wandering visage.
Sheâ€™s waiting for her lovers return;
He fights the mighty demons of lucifer,
Her lips are pouted pink in prayer;
For her loves safe guidance at war.
This beautiful angel is me, your Juliet;
The handsome knight is you, Romeo,
Return safely, it is only for you that I fret;
My love on you, forever Iâ€™ll bestow.

Election Narrative 

In my country
Democracy has been tasted
And it is a bitter pill
Its tenets of freedom and liberty
Are grossly abused
And the dictum
Of one man one vote
A mockery of the fact
There is a transition
And elections stare
In the faces of citizens
But it appears
They will never see the ballot boxes
In which their franchise
Will be exercised
The road to the eight senate
Is murky and crooked
That prediction of perdition
Is becoming inevitable
And we are waiting.

Holistic Narrative 

A project comes to an end-
Research and discovery goes on
Here, there are some lessons known
Goes on research-tales from all regions.
Awaiting award-winning documentaries
Now's the time to make educational-films
As an incentive to acquire maximum gains
Out of research, growth and development.
Allure from competitors watching interest-
Without fear of ravages of the nuclear-war
Suspending all high-up suspicions in the air
Boldly reaching the abode of gods in heavens.
Appropriating science history of Vedic Age-
A perfect step towards more holistic narrative.

In every thing that she does,
it is accompanied with a must.
People hated Zelle in simple ways
Through her willingness to have a base.
A base where she will be happy.
A base where she will excel.
Patience is a virtue,
that's what they say.
Willingness is also a virtue,
that's for me to say.
Zelle worked hard to find her goal.
Exert countless effort and made it bold.
Through heart-break things that she do,
People loves her tight.

Narrative Of Death 

As the patriot rounds the corner he sees a man, and there li
es a sturdy rusted object in the gentlemanâ€™s hand. The ma
n stabs the heroin in the back, object held in his fist. Th
e heroâ€™s body starts to relax, unable to resist. As the m
artyrâ€™s blood flows over the unsheathed blade, the murder
er lets out a laugh. The man in a puddle, a victim of raid,
 pleaded with a gasp, Please sir donâ€™t kill me I have a w
ife! I have two sons and a daughter. Please, I do want my sad life, I wish not be a prey of your slaughter.
There in a puddle they found him the next day, the knife in 
his back and the blood in his face. The world never noticed
 the crime happened to pass. He could have died calmly, die
d in the grass, but he died horribly died gory as the origi
nal mass. His family did mourn for he died for no cause. He was murdered in coldness, and it was all for his loss.

Narrative Of Love 

Narrative of Love
I do not know what is love But what you are
More than love for me my dear sweetheart
Your very presence is like real love don't debar
God has carved you with love an eternal art
Let me narrate your fragrance and essence
You dangle and dance but just all around me
You have taken over all my mind and sense
My love is a canoe your beauty is green sea
Why not to take pleasure being in love chain
Why not to transfer taste and flavor just across
Let us play hide and seek in cold dazzling rain
Let us win the moment, let us forget about loss

Narrative 

The Odd Narrative
Steamed up window my finger I paint a landscape,
Mountain, forest and a lake; the peak cries into
the lake it becomes a vast ocean,
where trees, are made into wooden rafts floats.
Midmorning, there is only an outline left of the crest,
this will happen to Himalaya,
it will be a grassland on a plateau, where horses gallop,
flying mane and all that,
since man won't be there to domesticate and make them
drag bunk beds and kitchen stoves around the pampas.
The rest of the world will have sunk into a big sea that is so still
it spends all its time mirroring the blue sky thinking it's seeing
is so deeply in love with the image,
that doesn't notice the man in a rowing boat; he's one time forgot,
he has married a big fish
which he thinks is a mermaid, every so often he  puts his hand in
the sea and strokes the fish's    belly: "without you, " he murmurs
"I would truly be alone."

Rains Narrative 

Oily, gleaming mirrors on tarmac,
Tyres causing greasy bubbles,
Birds dancing in natures baths,
Trees stretching out to catch the moisture,
Rainbow of umbrellas bobbing along,
Puddles ready for the children,
Not made though for the mums,
Cyclists despising every moment,
Raindrops racing down the window,
Internally betting which one will win,
Protected in my warm cocoon,
Indulging in the creature comforts,
I don't do drowned rat very well,
I will stay in this heavenly sanctuary,
Enjoying the narrative of the rain

Rehabilitation Of The Narrative 

Story before specifics
Biography before basics
This entertainment has become substance of talk
The fog of self-aggrandizement
The blurred lines of the myth as you
The parameters have bent from the heat of delusion
And I say delusion because the difference between narrative and self-introduction have muddled together
Have been lost in a torrent of brown rainwater filling the basin and overflowing
And they call this social media
And they call this your new smart TV
And they call this bootleg intellectual property easily available
When I was busted, the details were told in flat, spare language
Not a tall tale or dramatic monologue but merely my version of events
I hope we can save the story this way
I hope we can conserve the imagination, heal the imagination
, and fill the heart with a sense of proportion and an unjaded joy in reading further
Put in its place - bought from a bookstore, checked out from
 a library, read in bed or on a beach or while sitting in a cafe
The fascination of the terminator who ends himself by inhabiting this badly told fiction
Dry anecdotes the fourth time round
Crack and break like seat covers on a two decades old car

The Narrative Became Rearranged 

Feeling the onset of artificial tension,
Swallow that pill, as a headache arrives at about the same time,
Hearing talk about the price that is paid for moderate genius,
Hearing too much right now
The ringing begins while the rigging was in place,
The narrative became rearranged, then mangled,
Facial expression gone wayward,
Eyes sunken, gone six feet under in appearance
Now he no longer wants to see,
All he can do is cry for help,
Until the next events occur which leave him speechless as well
Something stinks,
But his ability to smell left him years ago
He can taste,
But he's too bitter to be interested,
As it makes no sense to him

Fillin shoppers' bags, ' the small boy said.
`My ma says not to believe a word you tell me-
Says you're a crack-pot, not right in the head.'

Like a circus lion, melting into a sieve
Her face as white's a Pierrot, lips like thunder

Unchanged Is The Narrative 

Unchanged is the narrative.
Unchanged and limited,
As if restricted to go beyond...
To make attempts to expand the mind,
In an enhancement to advance...
From what is repetitious.
Decaying yet not considered,
Overstating a worthlessness.
But kept to value for the purpose,
Of knowing a dead horse to beat it...
Gives many comfort to repeat this activity,
Over and over again.
With it done to feel good about themselves.
And rely upon receiving immediate validation.

World Should I Write A Narrative Of Modern Times 

Should I write a narrative of the modern times
If I am able to get it clear in my mind
When the news of the day is near
The truth of it all may not be clear

And heroes that will for some come to be
The search for truth is the aim in it all
Read it digest it and in in the end make your call.

An Octave About Sculpting In My Sexaholic Shopaholic Workaholic Series 

An Octave about sculpting in my Sexaholic Shopaholic Workaholic series
-Gayathri B. Seetharam
Acknowledgements: Wikipedia
Expressing my sexual ardour in different ways, I sculpted and baked an edible man with an aroused male organ
For in my boudoir as a Sexaholic, I have chosen privacy but openness of heart
My and my husband's bete noir is being surprised at the wrong time by our son
Besides, I have said Au Revoir to my husband's playing hard to get-act;
As a Shopaholic, I love to focus on my attire
But also lay bare my purse a little shopping for artistic and sculpting materials
For lots and lots and lots of the same thing bores me
And I did acquire as a Workaholic, by dint of hard work,6 good sculptures made by myself.

Life Expectancy Octave 

Second, minute, hour, day, month, year
Our life is rounding here,
Just a watch shows us time passes
Our figure tells us life passes,
Our future generations wait
For that very moment,
Our expectancy finishes, therefore
One day all will see we are no more.

Making Children Of Today Fit For Tomorrow Octave 

Teachers and parents are cultivators
Children are their seeds and plants,
So, they need prepare land carefully
Then sow and plant properly,
Yet they have to do more together
Water, weed out, manure and more,
Up to the crops grow expectedly
Well, finally all will harvest happily.

Millennium Developments Octave 

Millennium developments are nothing
But some dreadful weapons inventing
Like male bomb, female bomb for the first time
To give birth bastard bombs for all the times
Loosing mere pride and anarchy
Every nook and cranny
To loose curse committing wars illegally
To finish selves finishing others awfully.

Obtaining Happiness Octave

Our mortal bodies seek happiness
With which the earth is connected less,

For that first here must be signed
And the conditions must be followed

Even at dusk all is a twinkle twirl

Songs On The Octave 

A coherent blab packed
Within a matured mind
Seeking a genuine reason
All, remoted for a season
Attempt to make a tune
Results in a pure distune
Psyche of chracteristic inferiority
Affects the dame of superiority
Tale of historics reiterates a relic
Of a damsel hitting for the cosmic.
There was a rapture
Later resulted in rupture
In a giant school of thought
Where great ants were taught
Experts a tension observed
Professionals, a  novice reserved
One without a tonic will suffer
Like song without a tonic sofa
One who wants to be first lady
Shoud first learn to be a lady.

The Octave Of My Error 

Parched gates guard the entrance to your being,
And like a leper, I've been cast aside;
Shuttered windows, all that I can see now,
While in the gulch, I'm rumored to reside.
I'm supposed to die or leave here most quietly;
Never to disturb, the angels of the house;
You treat friendship so unseemly and unsightly,
My state's reduced, to lower than a mouse.
I wish I knew the octave of my error;
That note of wrong, thatâ€™s burnt into the wood:
I'd polish with oils, and try to make it fairer;
Anything to fix it, if only I still could.

0037 Ode To The Patience Of A Yawning Audience 

O come sweet sleep, and close my eyes with verse!
with drowsy metre, meet a deeper sleep;
to sleep, to dream, I never am averse -
to slumber numbed by poet's numbers deep;
so, here's a verse that's very brief - a sonnet:
just fourteen lines to challenge your attention:
please rest your weary ears, I pray, upon it;
head up; back straight; let go of any tension;
count the passing seconds to that time
-I'll indicate it with a final couplet -
when glorious English in immortal rhyme
blesses you with torpor's blissful duvet...
and after tribute paid to Orpheus' charms,
with stifled yawn, depart to Morpheus' arms...

performs her holy task; unheard, unseen,
except in trivial printed marks (- like this -)
punctilious editors put in - or erase;
yet, she's the Sherpa to the mind's high bliss
who leads our thoughts to peaks of silent praise;
immortal consort of the god of speech,
handmaid of mind, bestowing measured pause
between each thought; their silent truth to reach
by resting mind in mind's divine true cause.
O worship her, her power so great and blest,
whose shortest silence, wildest mind may rest!

An Ode For Ben Jonson 

Ah Ben!
Say how or when
Shall we, thy guests,
Meet at those lyric feasts,
Made at the Sun,
The Dog, the Triple Tun;
Where we such clusters had,
As made us nobly wild, not mad?
And yet each verse of thine
Out-did the meat, out-did the frolic wine.
My Ben!
Or come again,
Or send to us
Thy wit's great overplus;
But teach us yet
Wisely to husband it,
Lest we that talent spend;
And having once brought to an end
That precious stock,--the store
Of such a wit the world should have no more.

An Ode 

The merchant, to secure his treasure,
Conveys it in a borrowed name:
Euphelia serves to grace my measure;
But Cloe is my real flame.
My softest verse, my darling lyre
Upon Euphelia's toilet lay;
When Cloe noted her desire,
That I should sing, that I should play.
My lyre I tune, my voice I raise;
But with my numbers mix my sighs:
And whilst I sing Euphelia's praise,
I fix my soul on Cloe's eyes.
Fair Cloe blushed: Euphelia frowned:
I sung and gazed: I played and trembled:
And Venus to the Loves around
Remarked, how ill we all dissembled.

All hail to the Empress of India, Great Britain's Queen!

To sleep, and rising up, by the Eternal God;
Happy may her visions be in sleep ...
And happy her thoughts in the day time;
Let all loyal subjects drink to her health
In a flowing bumper of Rhenish Wine.
And when the final hour shall come to summon her away,
May her soul be wafted to the realms of bliss,
I most sincerely do pray, to sing with saints above,
Where all is joy, peace and love -
In Heaven, for evermore to reign,
God Save the Queen. Amen.

Fragment Of An Ode To Maia 

MOTHER of Hermes! and still youthful Maia!
May I sing to thee
As thou wast hymned on the shores of Baiae?
Or may I woo thee
In earlier Sicilian? or thy smiles
Seek as they once were sought, in Grecian isles,
By bards who died content on pleasant sward,
Leaving great verse unto a little clan?
O give me their old vigour! and unheard
Save of the quiet primrose, and the span
Of heaven, and few ears,
Rounded by thee, my song should die away
Content as theirs,
Rich in the simple worship of a day.

France An Ode 

EXCERPT]
...
O Liberty ! with profitless endeavour
Have I pursued thee, many a weary hour ;
But thou nor swell'st the victor's strain, nor ever
Didst breathe thy soul in forms of human power.
Alike from all, howe'er they praise thee,
(Nor prayer, nor boastful name delays thee)
[Image]Alike from Priestcraft's harpy minions,
And factious Blasphemy's obscener slaves,
Thou speedest on thy subtle pinions,
The guide of homeless winds, and playmate of the waves !
And there I felt thee !--on that sea-cliff's verge,
Whose pines, scarce travelled by the breeze above,
Had made one murmur with the distant surge !
Yes, while I stood and gazed, my temples bare,
And shot my being through earth, sea, and air,
Possessing all things with intensest love,
O Liberty ! my spirit felt thee there.

Ode On Solitude 

Happy the man, whose wish and care
A few paternal acres bound,
Content to breathe his native air,
In his own ground.
Whose heards with milk, whose fields with bread,
Whose flocks supply him with attire,
Whose trees in summer yield him shade,
In winter fire.
Blest! who can unconcern'dly find
Hours, days, and years slide soft away,
In health of body, peace of mind,
Quiet by day,
Sound sleep by night; study and ease
Together mix'd; sweet recreation,
And innocence, which most does please,
With meditation.
Thus let me live, unseen, unknown;
Thus unlamented let me dye;
Steal from the world, and not a stone
Tell where I lye.

LEST as the immortal gods is he,

'Twas this deprived my soul of rest,
And raised such tumults in my breast;
For, while I gazed, in transport tossed,
My breath was gone, my voice was lost;
My bosom glowed; the subtle flame
Ran quick through all my vital frame;
O'er my dim eyes a darkness hung;
My ears with hollow murmurs rung;
In dewy damps my limbs were chilled;
My blood with gentle horrors thrilled:
My feeble pulse forgot to play;
I fainted, sunk, and died away.

Find a place that's warm and cozy -

Washing out the cobwebs

Ever musing I delight to tread
The Paths of honour and the Myrtle Grove
Whilst the pale Moon her beams doth shed
On disappointed Love.
While Philomel on airy hawthorn Bush
Sings sweet and Melancholy, And the thrush
Converses with the Dove.
2
Gently brawling down the turnpike road,
Sweetly noisy falls the Silent Stream--
The Moon emerges from behind a Cloud
And darts upon the Myrtle Grove her beam.
Ah! then what Lovely Scenes appear,
The hut, the Cot, the Grot, and Chapel queer,
And eke the Abbey too a mouldering heap,
Cnceal'd by aged pines her head doth rear
And quite invisible doth take a peep.

Ode To Sleep 

On this my pensive pillow, gentle Sleep!
Descend, in all thy downy plumage drest:
Wipe with thy wing these eyes that wake to weep,
And place thy crown of poppies on my breast.
O steep my senses in oblivion's balm,
And sooth my throbbing pulse with lenient hand;
This tempest of my boiling blood becalm!
Despair grows mild at thy supreme command.
Yet ah! in vain, familiar with the gloom,
And sadly toiling through the tedious night,
I seek sweet slumber, while that virgin bloom,
For ever hovering, haunts my wretched sight.
Nor would the dawning day my sorrows charm:
Black midnight and the blaze of noon alike
To me appear, while with uplifted arm
Death stands prepar'd, but still delays, to strike.

Ode To The Only Girl 

I've seen you many times in many places--
Theater, bus, train, or on the street;
Smiling in spring rain, in winter sleet,
Eyes of any hue in myriad faces;
Midnight black, all shades of brown your hair,
Long, short, bronze or honey-fair.
Instantly have I loved, have never spoken;
Slowly a truck passed, a light changed,
A door closed--all seemingly pre-arranged--
Then you were gone forever, the spell was broken.
Ubiquitios only one, we've met before
A hundred times, and we'll meet again
As many more; in hills or forest glen,
On crowded street or lonely, peaceful shore;
Somewhere, someday--but how will we ever know
True love, how wil we ever know?

WHAT slender Youth bedew'd with liquid odours
Courts thee on Roses in some pleasant Cave,
Pyrrha for whom bind'st thou
In wreaths thy golden Hair,
Plain in thy neatness; O how oft shall he
On Faith and changed Gods complain: and Seas
Rough with black winds and storms
Unwonted shall admire:
Who now enjoyes thee credulous, all Gold,
Who alwayes vacant, alwayes amiable
Hopes thee; of flattering gales
Unmindfull.  Hapless they
To whom thou untry'd seem'st fair.  Me in my vow'd
Picture the sacred wall declares t' have hung
My dank and dropping weeds
To the stern God of Sea.

Palinode For The Mediterranean Girl 

Palinode For The Mediterranean Girl
January 10, 2020
O, Mediterranean Girl! How much time has gone?
Your sky is again covered with thick black clouds,
You can never see the sun
Gloominess, darkness ever frighten you; and
Around you all the devils are walking, running
Shallowing up things and beings
As the cruel beat animals mercilessly first
Then voraciously and horribly eat,
I know water in your oceans has been getting bloody
For century after century,
I know your oppressed atmosphere
For centuries has been shedding tears,
I am not gonna irritate you again
I am not gonna add to you more pain;
I am just gonna share the world pains you
Through a palinode as the old and real friends do.

Palinode For The Real Patriot

O, real patriot!
How to love country you have showed!
Loving rules, loving people,
Establishing the proper state of love and rule;
Now, here in the name of patriotism
Hyper hypocrisy runs as old maxim,
In the name of loving human and humanity
Run butchery, cheating, corruptions speedily,
How they do deal!
If you saw this, you this would only peril,
O, real patriot!
Among human beings you are the greatest!
This palinode is a so little tribute!
To the comparison you are so great!
All over the world those great follow you
Who wanna stand in the line headed by you.

Palinode 

Who is Lydia, pray, and who
Is Hypatia? Softly, dear,
Let me breathe it in your ear--
They are you, and only you.
And those other nameless two
Walking in Arcadian air--
She that was so very fair?
She that had the twilight hair?--
They were you, dear, only you.
If I speak of night or day,
Grace of fern or bloom of grape,
Hanging cloud or fountain spray,
Gem or star or glistening dew,
Or of mythologic shape,
Psyche, Pyrrha, Daphne, say--
I mean you, dear, you, just you.

A Panegyric To Hedonism 

Alcohol is the queen
Tobacco is her consort
So we can still die
We'll still be able to die
After delectable hours
Spent in the bars
Yes we wallow in reckless surfeit
Here is no religion station
People, the very essence
Of vice incarnate
The pious fear to tread
This God-forsaken place
But the binge is going on
Also hash, dead can dance or
Maybe Bob Marley and the Wailers
And American dollars
What else do you fancy?
For your euphoric felicity? !

Panegyric 

panegyric
Not a truth in the beginning
Not a truth in the ending!
Truth hides in suffocation,
As we are on the work,
Truth is not there.
Truth lies beneath actions.
Bitterness brings happiness
Night inaugurates lights in
The presence of darkness.
Dream begets strangerness
Likewise, sun making pearls of
Light in the heart of nights
Truths lie there though not truth!
I wonder and hate,
I envision and muse not;
Lies and truths mingle together
Likewise, I exist!

A secret, can't be told,
So in angst we're coldly stewing:
Damnation's in the fold
A secret can't be told-
We're hostages of fear;
Damnation, in the fold,
As we hide our every tear.
We're the hostages of fear,
In this darkness, growing fast;
We must hide our every tear,
For we know this calm can't last.
In this darkness growing fast,
And the fingers, grasping tighter,
We know this calm can't last;
We can't make this burden lighter.
And those fingers ever tighter;
There's a bad trouble brewing,
We can't make this burden lighter-
So in angst, we're coldly stewing

Trees losing their offspring and leaves,
Aged men and women in the sight,
Tales that coronavirus weaves,
Woodland losing its broods and leaves~
Static life as in a fast train,
Fears that the new virus weaves,
The breaths in the torrential rain,
Steady life as in a night train,
The hues' reverse into the past,
Stones in the sharp, pouring rain,
Stressed winds and waves seeming so vast,
Blue poppies and birds fixing the sky,
Aged, wrinkled couples in the sight,
Starved infants and angels to fly,
Pellucid windows in the light.

Past the stillness of this land
There lies a truth in every pain
Farther than they eye can see
The horizon stretches beyond pale
There lies a truth in every pain
A child in every soul
The horizon stretches beyond pale
Beyond the knowledge of this world
A child in every soul
Seeking answers in their quest
Beyond the knowledge of this world
Follow me child

Sleep Soundly Curse Pantoum 

There are thoughts I'd not allow to think, of you;
Though they carry you off in your sleep some night;
These words I shall not write down of you:
Asleep in my past, where you have no right.
They'll carry you off in your sleep, some night;
Beware, beware, for the time is late,
Sound asleep in the past, where you've no right,
An interloper seals his certain fate.
Beware, beware, for the time is late,
And you will die, inside those walls,
An interloper seals his certain fate;
Sleep soundly: till the anvil falls.
And you will die, inside those walls;
The ghosts of my loved ones number your breaths,
So sleep soundly, till that anvil falls;
For every nightmare's a new little death.
The ghosts of my loved ones number your breaths;
Though there are thoughts I'd not think of you,
And every nightmare's a new little death-
Though I'll write nothing down, of you.

The Coming Of Spring A Pantoum 

Winter's long days are almost done
Though furrowed fields lie dormant still
Overhead shines a gentle sun
Its promise of spring yet to fill
Though furrowed fields lie dormant still
Waiting for that warmth from above
Its promise of spring yet to fill
The young buds are forced from their glove
Waiting for that warmth from above
Tender shoots of green now appear
The young buds are forced from their glove
Assured that spring is almost here
Tender shoots of green now appear
Overhead shines a gentle sun
Heralding spring - now so near
Winter's long days are almost done.

She'll be Queen of the little land.

The Song Of The Lark Pantoum 

Alone, alone, I listened to a song,
The lovely, floating warble of a lark.
I heard the notes come drifting, clear and strong,
Until the daylight faded into dark.
The lovely, floating warble of a lark-
Its melody caressed my troubled soul
Until the daylight faded into dark
And velvet night concealed the gentle knoll.
Its melody caressed my troubled soul
While yet I lingered, charmed by peace and grace,
And velvet night concealed the gentle knoll
Before I left that sweet, enchanted place.
While yet I lingered, charmed by peace and grace,
I memorized each shimmering, silvery tone,
Before I left that sweet, enchanted place-
Then I was once again alone, alone.
I memorized each shimmering, silvery tone;
I heard the notes come drifting, clear and strong,
Then I was once again alone, alone.
Alone, alone, I listened to a song.

But none that he can keep;
Should I tell him a secret, if I could-
As he flits from tree to tree?
For there's none that he could keep-
Though all men were in their bed,
As he flits from tree to tree
Hearing whispers, in his head.
Though all men were in their bed,
It echoes through the night;

While every star shines bright.

A Pastoral 

Sweet birds! that sit and sing among the shady valleys,
And see how sweetly Phyllis walks amid her garden alleys,
Go round about her bower, and sing as ye are bidden:
To her is only known his faith that from the world is hidden,
And she among you all that hath the sweetest voice,
Go chirp of him that never told, yet never changed, his voice.
And not forget his faith that lived forever loved
Yet never made his fancy known, nor ever favor moved;
And ever let your ground of all your grace be this-
'To you, to you, to you the due of love and honor is,
On you, on you, on you our music all attendeth,
For as on you our Muse begun, in you all music endeth.'

For A Venetian Pastoral By Giorgione In The Louvre 

WATER, for anguish of the solstice:â€”nay,
But dip the vessel slowly,â€”nay, but lean
And hark how at its verge the wave sighs in
Reluctant. Hush! beyond all depth away
The heat lies silent at the brink of day:
Now the hand trails upon the viol-string
That sobs, and the brown faces cease to sing,
Sad with the whole of pleasure. Whither stray
Her eyes now, from whose mouth the slim pipes creep
And leave it pouting, while the shadowed grass
Is cool against her naked side? Let be:â€”
Say nothing now unto her lest she weep,
Nor name this ever. Be it as it was,â€”
Life touching lips with Immortality.

Freedom And Love Only In Pastoral Life 

Pastoral romantic life is the best way to live
In harmony with Nature full of lovely beauty,
Satisfaction and bliss in this world now sure!
This is the reason many opt for resorts to farm
Houses to enjoy holidays in peace and tranquility
To enjoy the bliss they are longing for in Nature!
Beauty and love together is a great boon to enjoy
Not anywhere in the modern world but only in Nature
Out of the limits of urban noise, pollution and all!
Even religions highlight pastoral lords preaching
About love, brotherhood, peace and blissful life
For the well being of humans to enjoy liberation!
Freedom and liberty one can experience only in the
Pastoral life with love and beauty supporting ever!

Kings Cross Pastoral 

When she remembers every chumpy thing
The baby weather hurts her, the sick sun
At home a dead blind flaps from its joint
She goes on,
like it's the latest reason or excuse
and hibernates with pity's taxied screen around her
I could cop it if it worked
She jilts the door, roneo'd with debts
Thought protects you from the street's chattels
The sky passes like a stick
A regular tip his crinkled rites of love
Joy cracks itself laughing
and with these crimes I shut the door
having gone off pity
The heart's anchor's dust now when he shows up
harmless, dishonest, recent
A car is better than a tree
Voices fall on the city's spine and crack

Montana Pastoral 

I am no shepherd of a child's surmises.
I have seen fear where the coiled serpent rises,
Thirst where the grasses burn in early May
And thistle, mustard, and the wild oat stay.
There is dust in this air. I saw in the heat
Grasshoppers busy in the threshing wheat.
So to this hour. Through the warm dusk I drove
To blizzards sifting on the hissing stove,
And found no images of pastoral will,
But fear, thirst, hunger, and this huddled chill.

Her whisper in the thorny bush when she blooms
and her fragrance spread all over the pasture.
A shepherd boy with the cattle
and the muddy river flows monotonously.
This beauty will change in near future
as they bring the bulldozer and caterpillar
the earth moving equipment.
A big project to establish a power plant by the riverside.
The contrary is give the light to the country
before the general election.
But wild flowers in agony
as they are scared to expose to the light.

Busy, grasshoppers jumping
Through daffodils resting
Leaping quietly in grassy delight
As daylight smiles in bright
That bluster in sparkling glint
While burning dog days squint
Quietness, overcomes the day
Standing proud in accolade
Surrounded by leafy trees
As well as, sprouting, shrubbery
Creating a glorious, pastoral, greenery
In soft, bright, airy, summery

Pastoral Epistemology 

Because we believe the material life is good
We test it and find this in it
Quite often ignoring to our detriment
The other plane called spirit.
A classic case of 'either-or' not untypical of European thought
The challenge is to come to Asia's wisdom of 'both-and'
And expand our possibilities.

The coffin is lowered
And we walk away
In silence.

Pastoral Malaise 

In time, though snow would fall, the barn keeps warm,
As chores for Summer had been done complete
The sleepy spell that soon befalls the farm
Could not, by slightest bit, its mirth deplete
The cows have all the hay on which to feed
With grains that with the fodder would enmesh
If hay is brown, I guess what cows would need
For each a green eyeglass, so things look fresh
The barn sparrows found crevices for nests
Though naught are seen by cat's eyes that explore
One way to find if flock thereat still rests
Is by the droppings scattered on the floor
Insects abide, in sizes big and small
And crawl among the bales, to chirp or play
Crickets and kin, that since the end of Fall
Have lodged as ground tenants without delay
As ants have piled a great mound of their own
In maze of subways, sans a subway train
The matriarchal state nature has shown
Bonded together on a female brain.

hawthorns wheeze with clandestine laughter
turning a new leaf, tide's out

beneath a tree grown from the pit I once spit out
I've hung nets to
trap birds, and waited how many years

If it were only still!â€”
With far away the shrill
Crying of a cock;
Or the shaken bell
From a cow's throat
Moving through the bushes;
Or the soft shock
Of wizened apples falling
From an old tree
In a forgotten orchard
Upon the hilly rock!
Oh, grey hill,
Where the grazing herd
Licks the purple blossom,
Crops the spiky weed!
Oh, stony pasture,
Where the tall mullein
Stands up so sturdy
On its little seed!

the night transports.
A means of coming to

To have once

Not changed toward

The towns raised chaffed
seas to ground them.
In that frieze before
storm you went on.
Effigy loomed out
of cornfield. Future

The Dove walks with sticky feet
Upon the green crowns of the almond tree,
Its feathers smeared over with warmth
Like honey
That dips lazily down into the shadow ...
Anyone standing in that orchard.So filled with peace and sleep,
Would hardly have noticed the hill
Nearby
With its three strange wooden arms
Lifted above a throng of motionless people
- Above the helmets of Pilate's soldiers
Flashing like silver teeth in the sun.

Pastoral 

And that crow's quill of a dreaded night,
darkened by earth's infernal grave;
and dried of ink in time's golden hour,
has but one such look from out of sight,
that by the sun in dull round of day,
you with all thy presence illumine the world;
until I, too, fade away in a nous of light,
see! how oft it hurts me to think on thee!
when half-eyed mirror in the morning dew,
of love's stony sleep through thine eye,
would burn all colours by the grey evening.

Pastoral Symphonies 

Storm clouds burst, lightning flashed
And howling breezes blew;
Thunder roared across the hills,
We stood together, just we two.
There was no place for shelter,
On we walked for many a mile.
A bleak night in November
On the cliff-tops, in the wild.
The waves lashed up like serpents
As they rushed to hit the shore
I threw my cape around you...
We could travel on  no more.
When at last the torrent ended,
The sun shone through the trees
And I could hear soft music playing
'Pastoral Symphonies'.

Pastoral Verse On Swimming Experience 

How nice to swim in sea, river, lake and pond!
Floating body, pressing water, moving forward
How nice to enjoy spattering, splashing sound!
Gesturing body, flapping wing, clapping hand,
I remember once while swimming with friend
To cross the local river to go to enjoy local band
Where we saw the singers sang hand in hand
In sweet voice, shaking body, hair, opening mind,
On the way home longitudinally in river we swam
All the while we gossiped and made lots of fun
Then we dove, caught fishes, late we returned home
Many happy did return in every sun and moon,
Now, we swim paying money in swimming pool
And in artificial lake without lily though waterful
But funless swimming, charmless time passing
Though it is a game here with heavy contesting.

Romantic Life In The Pastoral Setting 

Romantic way of living is the best way to enjoy love
And peace in the pastoral atmosphere near the towns
Far away from the world full of chaos and unrest ever!
Settlements on such beautiful surroundings of Nature
certainly give peace of mind, sense of joy in the
Calm and tranquil environment that makes life lovable!
Romantic intellectuals and poets of the past and even
Today are preferring to live in the farm houses outside
The towns and cities after saving income from works..!
Contention of heart only those good souls have ever in
The life of the world that has many things to observe,
Learn and know to have spiritual satisfaction in peace!
Development of romantic nature from the childhood on
Lead one and all to pastoral settings to live well sure!

Taboo Against The Word Beauty Pastoral Version 

So what if trains jostle our apples down?
If light that ripens each turns every brown?
The solution waits in unfallowed pasture
famous for twitch and fly buzz. It nickers
and stomps to taste a windfall. Gun shy
but wise to whip snap, it wallows in plenty
of dust. Meanwhile the equation inside
our blood, it strives to qualify our dying:
the crossties, rails and spikes that guide the train
no longer are consumed. What perfection
to feel the sugared apple sweetly crackle!
Our bodies, the only fruit that bruise then heal.
What if this dust is really a ghost arriving?
If elegy's for the dead, what's left for the living?

With the lambs coming to gift me a flower,

A Quatern Poem I Have Written For You 

A quatern poem I have written for you
With fragrant ink from Saudi Arabia,
In mighty pen from Egyptian Museum,
On colorful pad and paper from Japan;
Sitting in the Wales' queen's garden
A quatern poem I have written for you,
When the fragrant flowers were blooming
Roses were spreading charming smell;
Butterflies were more funny flying around
Some nice ones happily sat on the pad,
A quatern poem I have written for you
When I was in the most well mood;
It was early autumn and late afternoon
I was lucky as yet no leaf did fall
In deep mind being a little emotional

Do Not Put Flowers With The Dead To Engrave Quatern Verse 

Do not put flowers with the dead to engrave
But make them flowers when they are alive
To spread sweet smell, beauty and purity
To love other and to make other love all widely;
Dead body will be spoiled soon after engraving
Do not put flowers with the dead to engrave
Flowers need more to the alive in their working
As they spread active smell, beauty and purity;
If the alive are like flowers will pray for the dead
That will help the dead's souls to be successful
Do not put flowers with the dead to engrave
But pray for them for their salvation, above all;
The dead are lifeless but their deeds are living
Will help them to cross all the dangers in time
If you really want to do something great for them
Do not put flowers with the dead to engrave.

Easy Or Hard Quatern 

We can't have everything we want.
Some walk around with almost all.
While most folks don't even get some.
That's life and better accept it.
Can't force feeling on anyone.
We can't have everything we want.
You either gonna be lov'd or not.
The point is get with the program.
Life easy or hard you name it.
We make decisions along way.
We can't have everything we want.
Many folks win while the rest lose.
And that's the way all goes in life.
With God will make it thru rough times.
Loved or hated always be yourself.
We can't have everything we want.

Embrace Life Quatern 

Embrace your life no matter what.
Start with heartful of love and hopes.
Never let yesterday rob your dreams.
Look at this day with brand-new eyes.
The best for you might still to come.
Embrace your life no matter what.
Listen to the beat of your heart.
Nothings over till God says so.
Embrace day with all ups and downs.
Climbing to top of mountains hard.
Embrace your life no matter what.
There's light at end of dark tunnel.
Nothing stays the same in this life.
But there's always God, love, dreams, hope.
Pray be strong when things don't look good.
Embrace your life no matter what.

Enemy Tracks Quatern 

There are many tracks on the ground,
enemies could be anywhere,
the spoor does the tracker astound,
he looks carefully here and there.
To me the tracks look all the same,
there are many tracks on the ground,
I do not know from where they came,
how enemies are to be found.
To the tracker it is renowned,
the way that it is set, its line
there are many tracks on the ground,
to me looking almost as mine.
We drink water under a tree
find a booby trap tightly bound
that almost is disposing me,
there are many tracks on the ground.

Evil Activities In Quatern Verse 

Having rationality don't be greedy
And don't envy of any,
Don't be angry unnecessarily
And don't be the center of anger;
Don't make enemy illegally
And don't be enemy awfully
Don't hate bitterly to be hated
In this mortal world;
In their life all the greedy
All the guilty and all the angry
And all the envious
Develop hatred, enmity and chaos;
With the muse of satanic curse
Greed, envy, wrath, hatred, pride hover
To commit all evil and bestial activities
To cause humans harm one another.

From This City I Want To Escape Free Verse Quatern 

From this city I want to flee,
to find a place of some solace,
not again I want to return,
where city lights sometimes blind people.
I still think about how it was,
from this city I want to flee,
I cannot fit in this anthill,
a bridge to escape, I must find.
The city makes me uneasy,
I want to wander on the beach,
from this city I want to flee,
I want to vanish by bus or train.
Now I splash in a city stream,
at times are in the open air,
about freedom I can just dream,
from this city I want to flee.

God Is Faithful Quatern

To world proclaim all His glory

And want to serve Him forever.
My heart sing for Him many songs
My soul in Him always rejoices

And just know that I'm not alone
Jesus is near, not far away

Growing Old Quatern 

As we grow old we all slow down.
Our bodies go through many changes.
Metabolism slows down that too.
We lose muscle, some hair and teeth.
Nothing works the same when you're old.
As we grow old we all slow down.
As the body ages you get more tired.
Harder to get up, get going.
When getting old you lose your youth.
Most folks gain lots of wisdom too.
As we grow old we all slow down.
You forget more than used before.
Our children may all be grown up.
For senior's harder to move 'round.
We get wrinkles, gray hair, body hurts.
As we grow old we all slow down.

He Ll Give You Peace Hope Quatern

He'll help you to be strong

When you fight and struggle in vain
He'll give you peace and hope
And He'll take away your pain
When you're at end of rope
His love in your heart will flow
when your spirit is sad and low

When troubles pile wide and high
Ask Lord Almighty for help each day
Before God just kneel and pray

In The Market Of The World Quatern 

From the arrival of humans, creations in the earth
Vast markets in the world have been being on
Where walking human sellers and buyers all times
While selling and buying commodities for lives;
They are treating and ill-treating to the products
From the arrival of humans, creations in the earth
For, some are losing; some are gaining in markets
So, some are crying; some are laughing always
Nothing is halting for anyone in the earth, anyway
All that creations are quickly passing away
From the arrival of humans, creations in the earth
Though humans are trying to protest those's death;
Leaving behind the inevitable ideas and thoughts
In the markets they are merely doing what they want,
Vainly they are trying to swindle the universe
From the arrival of humans, creations in the earth.

Not This Song Never Quatern Poetry 

In the night,  the song  waves start to disappear
Like white trees, when there is no one their fall to hear.
Earth's shadow hides the moon, a harp without strings.
Lasting love shines  on crazy engagement rings.
What does love mean, when the elves come life to cheer?
In the night,  the song  waves start  to disappear,
And in the moonlight your feelings  become  blue.
The flowers cry for our time with tears of dew.
Bud butterflies become whispers in our dreams
To complete our entwining in the life's  streams.
In the night, the song  waves start to disappear
On the moon, a double-meaning pamphleteer.
The green knows that  through the darkness shines the light.
Love has a sense when the saints pray for the height.
And life blooms, when the God's angels hurry near.
In the night,  the song  waves start  to disappear.

On Facebook Quatern Form 

facebook is one of the recent social media
And not anybody's personal pages of book or notes,
Here people can start activities opening accounts
Where they post their photos, writings, etc. they like;
They post those and share with their friends
Some friends like them and highly comment
That inspires and helps them at the moment
Thus they amuse greatly among themselves;
And thus the number one nature of facebook is seen,
Through acting, reacting, liking, commenting and sharing
And these activities always differ and depend
From person to person and on personal demand;
Imparting and learning educations and information,
Running business, adding commodities and other;
Recreational sports, movies, cartoons and funs
Without some abusers' abusing it is quite good.

And birds are for ecological fit, therefore

Costly jewellery to women,
You say, "Put a note on our love"
Autumnal white clouds and catkin,
First spring's flower, smell and air;
You do not utter or beckon
I am yet answering on; then
You say, "Put a note on our love"
New leaves stir in the breeze of spring;
First baby laughs at lap of mom,
Oasis at desert to walkers,
Only the moon shines at the dark
You say, "Put a note on our love."

Quatern For Our Playful Pet Tom 

Long of the time of day she likes sleeping
Rest of the time she likes playing and hunting
During playing she also hunts sometimes
This playful Tom is our adorable pet cat;
She demands well caress and food in time
Long of the time of day she likes sleeping
But every day she normally gets up early
And so she needs food and sleep properly;
Fish is the most favorite food item to her
Then she is fond of meat, milk, bread, sweet;
Long of the time of day she likes sleeping
Killing harmful insects she does something;
She does not like taking bath every day
But she goes to toilet willingly and usually,
Sometimes she likes going out for visiting
Long of the time of day she likes sleeping.

The rays of the first sun of New Year
At the early morn just after it rising
Is beautifully smiling seen through the window pane
And makes me laugh frankly on;
And fills me with unending ecstasy
The rays of the first sun of New Year
Shows much hopes for humanity,
Persuading my mind with truth beauty and equity;
I warmly welcome it as the earth has been
A stony spot without any point of softness,
The rays of the first sun of New Year
You come to fill the narrow hole of hopelessness;
It seems bestowing a great pleasure to me
But, how is to others in this same earth?
I think to be the same for year round to all humans
The rays of the first sun of New Year.

France is a beautiful place,
With so much history to see,
And so many people to meet,
And so much food to eat.
This is what makes it fun because
France is a beautiful place,
And meeting Victor Hugo would be great,
And meeting French poets even greater.
The Enlightenment happened here,
With Montaigne, Rousseau, and Diderot, since
France is a beautiful place,
And Alexandre Dumas would have been proud.
Kings and queens ruled here,
Until Robespierre took control,
And democracy started, and ah,
France is a beautiful place.

On the true progress making works,

In the Red Sea, you were my lonely king of salt,
You were my beautiful statue made of basalt.

You were my statue representing the king of sand.
Your body was looking as it was tattooed with smalt.
In the Red Sea, you were my lonely king of salt.
At the water high waves' mobile horizon
I was a mermaid, caught in your love's prison.
I swam to the surface, sometimes, to see you.
You were on your ship, at the dawn's purplish blue.
In the Red Sea, you were my lonely king of salt.
I had your beautiful statue, made of basalt.
I paid to get rid of my tail and to become a woman,
Because I wanted you to be my lover and my man.
You disappeared and your wreck was anchored in Galt,
In the Red Sea, youâ€™re my lonely king of salt.

The Range Of Pollution And Corruption Quatern Verse 

Our school is the second to our big society
Every male and female are here students
Willingly and unwillingly they have to study
For life, worldly and spiritually development;
Again, our society is the second to nature
Nature is source and holder of former two
Are the school and the society together
For their growing, learning and earning cue;
Sometimes our social rules and subjects
Are made well, fair and clear to understand
Sometimes are unclear and quite vague
For some socio-political leaders' evil hands;
School, society have already been corrupted
Now nature is undertaken and planned,
And a certain percent of it has already been
Captured, poisoned and polluted by them.

anza's second line, the third stanza's third, and the final stanza's fourth.

My humble soul receives its worth
as hands caress the fertile soil.
A grateful earth rewards my heart
with gift of seed to tend and sow.
As saplings rise from 'neath the ground,
my humble soul receives its worth.
They seek nutrition from the sun
and thirst for April's sodden dower.
through tender care they thrive and grow
and in return they nourish me.
My humble soul recieves its worth
with every breath of pure grown air.
With every blossom's lovely bloom,
with every grass and tree that's green,
with every rose whose thorns do sting,
my humble soul receives it's worth.

Thrust into the dark emptiness of eternity
And whose breath cast them adrift with a kiss
What source of Glory started this maternity
When the radiant glow of creation broke
And tiny myriads of stardust start to glow
The point when from nothingness time awoke
Where glowing beauty of spheres did grow
Those youthful orbs then sped away
Through the inky darkness they sung
In glorious splendour of colour they play
The symphony of their choir then rung
Oh Cosmic Dawn when did you start
In the vast empty wideness of space
Before time started to play his part
Where is the Glory of your Divine face
Now you dance such glowing orbs
You continue to expand in space
Drunk with your charm our minds absorb
The infinity of your ageless grace

That she could make my life so new
She is my Holly Blue sweet butterfly
For her sweet love I would surely die

Oh romance for us will never be
She has another for all to see
I will never know her love of bliss

Leaves Are Thieves Italian Quatrain 

The Sun shines on all, including the leaves,
From waking to the time it goes to sleep.
But leaves rob Sun, who is a sleeping sheep,
They pretend to play, but are really thieves!
Leaves take from the rich to give to the poor;
Gaining escape by changing currency,
Masking trails - making the heist seem easy.
And each day, leaves continue to rob more.

You have accepted
As I am no more in wrongs
No more in corruptions;

No more in envy
No more in guilty
No more in cruelty

With Christmas trees, when they abide
Each looks like a cotton candy ball.

In their nests, the squirrels like to hide.

Wandering As A Cloud Analogy Quatrain 

Our lives are but clouds wandering across a sky
Restlessly drifting along with a tempestuous wind
Sometimes billowing puffed up sometimes thinned
Or grey with darkened streaks of lightning flashing by
They speed with no mercy in the jet stream high above
Or labouring they shed their heavy load upon the soil
With cymbalsâ€™ of crashing thunder they bubble and boil
Yet with ageless beauty theyâ€™re looked on with love
Like clouds our lives are full of wandering thoughts
Those times we feel happy or pain or laugh or we weep
We play and we work and make appointments we canâ€™t keep
Of winning the lottery a cheque ending one and six noughts
And have dreams of wielding power prestige or of love
But spare a thought for those with monotonous dread
We all drift through this mortal life until we are dead
And live in memories and history that once we were part of
We are those wandering clouds in the heat of the day
We start out as nothing just a few gentle wisps that grow
Shaped by the wheel of fortune as fate takes a throw
Then when our cloud evaporates we simply fade away

Blessings Decline Rictameter 

Blessings Decline - Rictameter
March 4, 2020
Love is
And be always
In lovely hearts, as these
Are made for this, and not for hearts
That are stone; destroy, kill, break prayer halls
Causing chaos worldwide; for them
Human world seems to be hell,
Blessings decline
From world.

Raggae in the mindblowing breeze
To the rustling music

Here A Riddle Has Drawn A Strange Nailmark 

Here a riddle has drawn a strange nailmark. To sleep now!
I'll reread, understand with the light of the sun,
But until I am wakened, to touch the beloved
As I do has been given to none.
How I touched you! So touched were you even by the copper
Of my lips, as an audience is touched by a play,
And the kiss was like summer; it lingered and lingered,
Only later the thunderstorm came.
And I drank in long draughts, like the birds, half-unconscious.
The stars trickle slowly through the throat to the crop,
While the nightingales roll up their eyes in a shudder
From the firmament draining the night drop by drop.

In My Surreal Dream Riddle Neo Modernist Poem 

Irreversibly, the yellow of the sun slips into
the leaves. Placidly, they fall from the Jabuticaba trees to the black
ground. Imperceptibly, I'm falling
asleep near you. Thereis cold, cold, and
a new autumn enters into my surreal space.
As long as
the trees are yellow, the life is insecure.
Undoubtedly, my roundland of love is
riddled with hate.Steely,
there is a riddle of
hailstones in this autumnal scent of flowers to break
everything around. Unflappably, I am stronger than steel, when
I have a will to survive. You're still there
behind the waterfall that spreads fear. Panicked, the night
falls when the moon pulses light.
There are shadows in the darkness, and I
cannot find the way out.
Where am I? Where am I?

Thou art no death, life in a renewed search
Of next innings to persist once again,
Bird priming wings, in search of a new perch,
Life's melody singing the old refrain!
A lost bird in search of his twin for longâ€”
A bird of the same flock, preening its feather,
All set for a voyage new things to weather,
O why this vainest search? What has gone wrong?
A bubble of sea water nigh restless,
Life struggles, longs its true lineage to trace,
To merge unto her infinite sameness,
Die bubble's life, other drops to embrace.
To most us still life is a strange riddle,
Amid two unknowns, mysterious middle!
_____________________________________________ _________
Indic scriptures are filled with philosophies on life and de
ath. Death is just a shadow, for, light is not far. Yet, it
 is a grave shadow all the same, and the pun is intended. I
t enables the soul a new vehicle to move on with new life; 
a new garment, for, the old is worn out. It's like a settin
g sun, sure to rise again. The metaphors are endless. We still grieve for life no less. It's not easy to transcend Maya.

Mother Tongue Wrung Moth Riddle Exeter Book970 A D 

A gourmand moth by night, unheard, had guzzled
the words by day enlightened man might write.
That God should tolerate their fate Iâ€™m puzzled,
where words and worm take flight, false fly-by-night!
Naught gnawing moth draws from the fine print nuzzled,
ignorance leaves leaves holy holey â€˜spite
the read, mark, inwardly digest points causal
on sight on site consumed.  Moth, uncontrite,
from feast grows neither plump nor bright, mind muzzled,
blind to spells magic mankind may in[k]dite.
A moth ate words. I thought that was quite curious, that a m
ere worm, a thief in the dark, ate what a man wrote, his br
illiant language and its strong foundation. The thief got n
o wiser for all that he fattened himself on words.  Answer to the Riddle: Bookworm

My Life Is Like A Riddle 

When I look back
at my life
and see how fast
everything pass,
I sometimes wonder why
things happen
and life takes its course?
How many times
my life reflects
things like a riddle,
of which I do not know
the answers.
Still I trust Him
who can make
all things new,
to touch my life
with His love.

Old English Riddle 

My dress is silent when I tread the ground
Or stay at home or stir upon the waters.
Sometimes my trappings and the lofty air
Raise me above the dwelling-place of men,
And then the power of clouds carries me far
Above the people; and my ornaments
Loudly resound, send forth a melody
And clearly sing, when I am not in touch
With earth or water, but a flying spirit.

Riddle 

From rosy bowers we issue forth,
From east to west, from south to north,
Unseen, unfelt, by night, by day,
Abroad we take our airy way:
We foster love and kindle strife,
The bitter and the sweet of life:
Piercing and sharp, we wound like steel;
Now, smooth as oil, those wounds we heal:
Not strings of pearl are valued more,
Or gems enchased in golden ore;
Yet thousands of us every day,
Worthless and vile, are thrown away.
Ye wise, secure with bars of brass
The double doors through which we pass;
For, once escaped, back to our cell
No human art can us compel.

I am one of the wonders of the heavens.
I am seen as many objects, signs and creatures.
At times, they see me as a dog, a lion or even a scorpion.
Though I appear in people's view most times,
they can never hold me. I am small, yet enormous, near, yet far.
Many stories revolve around me, oftentimes,
I am associated with the gods.
Travelers seek my guidance as they travel.
I am beautiful, elegant, shining and splendid in the eyes of men.
People wish to earn knowledge about me,
my wonders and my origins.
Although I may not be visible in your eyes at all times,
I am always looking down upon you with my everlasting gaze.
I live long- far longer than any living creature can live.
Yet I am not deathless. I too, lose my light and die.
And my death gives birth to another, a youngster to take my place.
Who am I?

The Riddle Of The World 

Know then thyself, presume not God to scan
The proper study of Mankind is Man.
Placed on this isthmus of a middle state,
A Being darkly wise, and rudely great:
With too much knowledge for the Sceptic side,
With too much weakness for the Stoic's pride,
He hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest;
In doubt to deem himself a God, or Beast;
In doubt his mind and body to prefer;
Born but to die, and reas'ning but to err;
Whether he thinks to little, or too much;
Chaos of Thought and Passion, all confus'd;
Still by himself, abus'd or disabus'd;
Created half to rise and half to fall;
Great Lord of all things, yet a prey to all,
Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurl'd;
The glory, jest and riddle of the world.

A Rispetto On Canada 

A Rispetto on Canada
-Gayathri B. Seetharam
Rispetto, (Italian: "respect, ") plural rispetti, a Tuscan f
olk verse form, a version of strambotto. The rispetto lyric
 is generally composed of eight hendecasyllabic (11-syllabl
e)lines. In its earliest form the rhyme scheme was usually 
abababcc. Later, the scheme ababccdd became more prominent,
 and other variations can also be found (ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITTANICA) .
Canada is a lovely work of art
It is a creation of mostly beauty
And its apt aspect is that it is vast
Its nature of brevity are witty summers
Its people come from different cultures
The only caricatures are men as mooses
And beavers with their dances as women
Canada has no dunces as its women.

To love a tree, I'd never thought

her shelter in a fickle clime
and Eros shot us both this time;
Apollo's son and Daphne's daughter.
Sweetly she affirms my court
with pretty sighs while I cavort
on dappled thyme - oh how sublime!
to love a tree.
The birds are charmed by my disport;
I freely fertilize and water
hidden roots before I climb
to squeeze her purple fruits and I'm
relieved it breaks no civil law

A Rondeau Of College Rhymes 

Our college rhymes,--how light they seem,
Like little ghosts of love's young dream
That led our boyish hearts away
From lectures and from books, to stray
By flowery mead and flowing stream!
There's nothing here, in form or theme,
Of thought sublime or art supreme:
We would not have the critic weigh
Our college rhymes.
Yet if, perchance, a slender beam
Of feeling's glow or fancy's gleam
Still lingers in the lines we lay
At Alma Mater's feet today,
The touch of Nature may redeem
Our college rhymes.

broken things do me of your anger remind.
There are so many things that to you I want to tell,
the depths of your soul at times I want to find
and I hate it when you scream and yell;
at times you are full of love.
I love you too much to leave you behind

Is on account of bliss that's much desired."
These were the very words she gently proferred,
Meaning to appease my growing flame.
But speaking thus, she did my heart inflame
Her breath more fragrant than a balsam balm
Fanned the fire for which Love has been prepared,
On kissing her.
Yes, no-one knew how much my soul became
So fevered on the mouth of my sweet dame
Whose amorous body died, or so it seemed,
And if our joined lips much longer had been sealed
She would have sucked my soul out, I proclaim,
On kissing her.

Door O Th Future Rondeau Of A High School Graduate 

Door oâ€™thâ€™ future, open to me.
Let all of these years speak to thee.
Sleepless, we have woken
and faced thy challenge, broken,
to, at last, set ourselves free.
Free from the past from which we flee
to thine arms by thy most holy
command, which, in love, you have spoken,
Door oâ€™thâ€™ future.
So look upon us favâ€™rably,
and give us opportunity.
Thy reach shall be eâ€™er unspoken:
thy plan for us, eâ€™er unbroken
as you remain clothed in mystâ€™ry,
Door oâ€™th future.

Do Remember Rondeau 

Do remember my true love when I cannot stay,
when by destiny locked-down from you I am away,
when all of life changes from what we have planned
and then sincerely do trust me and try to understand
that in such a terrible time I can only hope and pray.
Everything, event and day is in God's almighty hand
and I know there will come another pest-free lovely day
where people will live in joy in the world and this land.
Do remember
when separate from me destiny takes you on your way,
where illness and death the virus do at every door lay,
that between you and me remains a bond and a band,
God does care and act as death do at the door stand,
do rememberâ€¦

Echoes Breathe Deep Traditional Rondeau Format 

Echoes breathe deep 'neath Church steeples,
wind warped chimes chase spiral pathways,
stations, novenas, the Passion and the Death.
Funeral's tend to cumber heavy hearts
choke the lungs from the grief and organ.
Myrrh stings the eyes like darning needles,
spiraled smoke dances 'round gothic lamps;
the starched 'March of Death' sleeps below them,
as Echoes breathe deep, sore unlaboured,
while mourners sit in pews profusely sweating.
Morning sun bleeds heavy through stained glass.
'Resurrection' Masses tend to cause discomfit,
leave grey, hollow hearts in deep bereft;
thank God for the cool steeple breeze;
when echoes breathe deep...in wake of the dead.

Empyreal Rondeau 

In ghostly skies a stellar glow
from erstwhile stars of long ago
that shone with splendor ere they died,
perchance were wished on starry-eyed,
still haunts in heavens' spectral show.
We gaze with wonder from below,
amidst our scurries to and fro,
at panoramas mythified
in ghostly skies.
The winds of fame and fortune blow
with sound and fury fiercely, though
our life be ebbing like the tide;
for death o'er all shall yet preside,
unfathomed as the cosmic flow
in ghostly skiesâ€¦

For Winter Is Here Rondeau 

For winter is here with cold days and deep snow
The thoughts of hot summers gone long ago
Now days are short and grey clouds fill the sky
And shivering nights that make you cry
Wearing colourful woolly hats wherever you go
And cups of steaming hot soup making you glow
Standing at a freezing bus stop Oh that wind does blow
Then seeing the bus coming and driving right on by
For winter is here
Icicles hanging from houses then dropping below
Like arrows or spears that athleteâ€™s throw
Walking snow in the house Oh nothing keeps dry
The weather forecast is for more snow and you sigh
So hunker down write poetry a Sonnet, Haiku or Rondeau
For winter is here

Hippogriff House A Rondeau 

Whoâ€™d buy that house named â€˜Moly Scaleâ€™
on Justice Point thatâ€™s up for sale?
I sailed around the Point by skiff;
the old house gripped the tilting cliff
alive behind a vapour veil.
I hid there in a winter gale
which played through tower, eaves and rail,
a contrapuntal eldritch riff.
Whoâ€™d buy that house?
Its iron feet impale stacked shale
with eagle claws and horseshoe nails.
Though shingled wings and joints are stiff,
should limestone fail, the Hippogriff
might fly to Shangrila or flail.
Whoâ€™d buy that house?

Hope A Rondeau 

This airy cage is foliage lined.
Its supple bars are intertwined.
The women show me where to tread.
I pluck and spin a cotton thread.
My woven home is hardwood spined.
The roots have poison deep confined.
We boil and dry before we grind.
I chew the bread but hope has fled
this airy cage.
The long flute's low hum numbs my mind.
A line of dancers slowly wind.
Their skins are painted black and red.
A shaman waves a shrunken head.
I think my love will never find
this airy cage.

If There Were No Moon Rondeau Redouble 

If there were no moon dark would be the night;
the sun bereft without her maiden glow.
Our eyes devoid of her seductive light
and all her gifts once lavishly bestowed.
Igniting seas emblazoned in her tow;
invading shores directed by her flight,
waves retreat when once gallantly they rose
if there were no moon dark would be the night.
No harvest fields or phases that delight;
new to full her embodiments unfold
in tangent skies just lonely specks of light,
the sun bereft without her maiden glow.
In our greed, like a trinket she was sold,
now we're lost to the privilege of her sight
and we will weep with stricken empty souls
our eyes devoid of her seductive light.
In vain we want, as often is our plight,
for her return by stellar winds to blow
her back to home! We crave our mother's light
and all her gifts once lavishly bestowed.

Infinite Rondeau 

Infinity is what we sense
when musing on the vast immense
with universes yet to mold
in starry heavens still untold
awaiting gazers in suspense.
Astronomers of why and whence
search stelliferous pathways dense,

infinity.
The great sidereal events
in views the firmament presents
upon the cosmic canvas scrolled
shall neverendingly unfold
for poets of the future tense

In Gods Garden Canvas Altered Rondeau 

In God's garden canvas
In God's garden canvas, I am the brush;
each stroke deliberate...I never rush.
Creating textured layers as I go,
allying pigment, applying VanGogh.
In reverance, I work in whispered hush.
The Earth, a chalice of flowering rush,
does make this artist's seed burst forth and gush
granting life to lovely violaceous.
In God's garden canvas.
I adopt diffused hues of Claude Monet;
exploit lines, plant colors, the Matisse way.
Sow the obscure lines of Picasso's heart.
Harvest the emotion from Renoir's art.
I am a creative vessel of aide.
In God's garden canvas.

In The Summer Rondeau 

In the summer we look forward to the sun
To hot sunny days and going for a run
Along golden sands and miles of beach
Then lay in the sun with an ice lolly each
Those long endless days of having fun
With your love two hearts that beat as one
Giving her that teddy bear you have won
In the arcade on the pier Oh lifeâ€™s a peach
In the summer
Groups of old ladies the heat they do shun
And old men chat about yarns they have spun
Childrenâ€™s sandcastles the tide will soon breach
And mothers telling their children to stay within reach
Then return to the hotel when the day is now done
In the summer

I Still Dream Rondeau 

I still dream of my love in the brightness of our days
When we walked along the beach our love ablaze
When I held her in my arms my own sweet song
Through lifeâ€™s challenges our love remained strong
Of birthday cards presents and daffodil sprays
Or picnics in a field under a tree where weâ€™d laze
Where lost in that limpid blue of her eyes Iâ€™d gaze
It was in my own heart that her love did belong
I still dream of my love
Our love was pure bliss and never did faze
It grew stronger and stronger a flame to a blaze
We thought love would be forever but we were wrong
But nothing is forever and nothing life long
An angel claimed her and left me in a daze
I still dream of my love

What harm alive, to you, was she?
Death, I cry out at your harshness,

If heart's dead, yes, then I foresee,
I'll die, or I must lifeless be,

Lords Of Survival Modified Rondeau 

Lords of survival stalk the night
Phantoms beneath the Northern Lights
Hungry, restless the hunt begins
Bonds renewed, they circle downwind
Across the tundra snowy white
Lords of survival stalk the night
Weary elk press on with fright
The pristine forest in their sights
The hungry wolves closing in
Lords of survival stalk the night
Overhead the moon and stars bright
The weary bull too weak to fight
The saga of life played again
On strength and cunning life depends
The distance closed, howls pierce the quiet
Lords of survival stalk the night.

Memory A Rondeau 

To iron a shirt, first lightly spray,
then left and right hand interplay;
with one to press and one to lead,
the path's prepared, the creases freed
and gathered wrinkles fade away.
The woman's old, in slow decay,
she's taken care of every day,
yet restless hands still feel the need
to iron a shirt.
Her mind now tends to disarray,
yet sometimes skills, long practiced, stay
and though she lacks her former speed,
her family and friends concede,
she's always known the proper way
to iron a shirt.

the words would only be in vain
I miss the birds, I miss the breeze
why am I here?

so in this place I shall remain
family members I must appease
to give them all a sense of ease
I miss the sun. I miss the rain

Old Wes10 Wes Is Obsessed Rondeau 

Wes is obsessed; is that a crime?
He posts this picture all the time.
The girl is pretty; that's for sure,
But I can't take it anymore!
She's much too young; I'm past my prime.
I know he thinks she's just sublime,
But stop this crazy pantomime,
Or Donna will show him the door!
Wes is obsessed.
He won't do free verse; won't do slime,
And all his poems have to rhyme,
But there are more forms to explore.
Give some a try; we won't keep score.
(Just try to sell them for a dime.)

Plosion At Konyu Cutting Rondeau

a railway through a limestone rise

Itâ€™s hell, and one in three donâ€™t make
it home, and some survivors quake
when spectres fly until they die
and when itâ€™s done.
Hibiscus, teak and fig trees stake

Queensland Summer Rondeau 

Queensland summer strays in to scuttle Spring.
Dissolve its breath; no more its song to sing.
Time now for us to return to the sound of the sea,
its jests, its restless passion, and gypsy-free
follow the gulls, our hearts like theirs on the wing.
For an hour or two each day together we'll bring
books, umbrella: in silent thought we'll fling
last year's old cares, content on Nature's knee.
Queensland summer.
We'll swim on the jelly waves and turn to swing
and stretch our bodies on the breakers' long white string.
Watch children build sandcastles, two or three.
Watch walkers stride the sand like you and me
until the Fall sweeps in with its sighing sting.
Queensland summer.

Caught up by love that drives me beyond the bounds,
To break the agreements is to me what matters,
To laugh, although I tear my heart in tatters,
Caught out by love that drives me beyond the bounds.
Between the skies where you are is your look-out:
The bloody pennant's raised, the airship falls,
No land in sight, a rope, perhaps, that holds
Between the skies. Where you are is your look-out.

Rondeau At The Train Stop 

It bothers me: the genital smell of the bay
drifting toward me on the T stop, the train
circling the city like a dingy, year-round
Christmas display. The Puritans were right! Sin
is everywhere in Massachusetts, hell-bound
in the population. it bothers me
because it's summer now and sticky - no rain
to cool things down; heat like a wound
that will not close. Too hot, these shameful
percolations of the body that bloom
between strangers on a train. It bothers me
now that I'm alone and singles foam
around the city, bothered by the lather, the rings
of sweat. Know this bay's a watery animal, hind-end
perpetually raised: a wanting posture, pain
so apparent, wanting so much that it bothers me.

A little warmth begins a wave
which dances on a network stave

Soft oscillations, safe confined,
a nascent mind in new bone cave.
Instinctively a life will crave
a pulse in phase to gently lave
in harmony, and so to find
a little warmth.
Eventually a life must waive
the frame it can no longer save.
The pattern quivers unaligned,
electric â€˜I' to heat resigned,
and flowing from the past enclave,
a little warmth.

Rondeau For Spring 

As winter's white succumbs to ebb,
Moraine strewn highway spans ahead.
Embattled stretch; asphalt; concrete
Dismal hostage revealed beneath.
Grayscale hues from granite through ash
Exposed were carcasses and trash.
Allowed again to decompose,
Twitch the season; its final throes.
As winter's white succumbs to ebb.
Soon the return of cousins fled.
Harbinger's cueâ€”not all is dead.
Whispered natureâ€”it's almost spring
Chickadees of days grown longer sing.
Soon their song with the garden wed,
As winter's white succumbs to ebb.

our assets from a victorâ€™s raid;
theyâ€™re pinned mid broadswords, sparks and flints

But Brananâ€™s lads both wear cockades,

seeks vacant coral real estate.
The choice begins events which dim

After many years a butterfly came and fluttered above
In the kitchen in the wintertime, uncharacteristic of
Insect life, but was never seen again after it flew straight.
She showed her love.
It was Maria saying goodbye like a dove
sent from Heaven with a solution thereof
to life's problems; Saying â€˜You don't need to wait,
You can come with me to the pearly gate'
In a dream wearing white with her hand to take hold of
She showed her love.

Silence Tightly Tugs Rondeau 

Silence tightly, tugs-
We lose contact, it unplugs.
Disconnected I still wonder
your way. Loving still tender,
But  bliss still lags.
Polluted by pain I lost my legs-
Looking at you blow away the ground pegs
Me here- As you surrender,
Silence tightly, tugs.
Sweet now sour, fruits now figs-
All to waste like rotting eggs
Was it love we fear,
Or luck we lack, my dear?
Our only findings:
Silence tightly, tugs.

Song Rondeau 

Finish these langours! Oh! I'm sick
Of dying airs, I know the trick;
Long since I've learn'd to well explain
Th'unmeaning cant of fire and pain,
And see through all the senseless lies
Of burning darts from killing eyes;
I'm tir'd with this continual rout
Of bowing low and leading out.
Finish, &c.
Finish this tedious dangling trade,
By which so many fools are made;
For fools they are, whom you can please
By such affected airs as these:
At opera near my box to stand,
And slyly press the given hand,
Thus may you wait whole years in vain;
But sure you would, were you in pain.
Finish, &c.
END

Spirited From The Guf A Rondeau 

The rondeau is a three-stanza poem consisting of approximate
ly ten to fifteen lines total, generally with either eight 
syllables per line or ten. Its distinctive features are the
 use of only two rhymes throughout the entire poem and a ha
lf-line refrain which begins the first stanza's first line 
and forms the entirety of the second and third stanza's las
t lines. The rhyme scheme varies with the number of lines. 
 A typical rhyme scheme for a fifteen-line rondeau is aabba
 aabC aabbaC, where C represents the first half of the rond
eau's first line. The refrain does not rhyme with anything else in the poem.
Spirited from the Guf
Spirited from the Guf, two precious lives.
On winged angels, from heaven derived.
Twice, for me, did joyous herald bells ring
one babe in winter and one babe in spring.
Their luminous souls, my spirit revived.
My winter surprise did swiftly arrive.
the other so slowly, spring was contrived.
For each little soul, sweet sparrows did sing
spirited from the Guf.
Our lives, they were dull, and somewhat deprived
before these children brought joy to our lives.
Now, my sated heart, does gleefully cling
to infinite love these cherubs did bring.
Because of our love, their souls will survive.

We yearn this welkin world to know
through avid searching to and fro
and seek a sculpted cosmic cast

The Dirge On My Niece Rondeau 

She came, she's gone forever; our prettiest daughter
Our sweetest child couldn't live longer
The atmospheric earth didn't allow her in birth
Clutched her pneumonic bar with polluted air at birthing mirth
Three days with three nights she's lived in lungs jar
None we can touched, just observed from far even her mother
For fluctuation of blood we're sadden always in fear
Test after test as the advice of doctor fired on our anxious hearth
Although she came, she's gone forever
As long as she lived we're in praying within fear as believer
To get back her healthy spent time in altruistic deeds all family member
Dawn to dusk all through night it seemed she's flirted love
In beseeching doctor we're shocked with broken heart
In haggard night she left us lonely to the world of another
Although she came, she's gone forever

The Rondeau 

You bid me try, Blue Eyes, to write
A Rondeau. What! Forthwith!--Tonight?
Reflect. Some skill I have, 'tis true;
But thirteen lines!--and rhymed on two!--
'Refrain,' as well. Ah, hapless plight!
Still, there are five lines--ranged aright.
These Gallic bonds, I feared, would fright
My easy Muse. They did, till you--
You bid me try!
That makes them eight.--The port's in sight:
'Tis all because your eyes are bright!
Now just a pair to end in 'oo,'--
When maids command, what can't we do!
Behold!--the Rondeau, tasteful, light,

Where I Stand Full Of Wonder Rondeau 

Where I stand full of wonder where the sun rises over the hill
with bright light the valley, the plain does fill
while I see the rushing waves rolling in and out of the sea
and there is a kind of joy in me
where I am away of the city's ill.
Here all of nature seems free
although the wind has a kind of chill
and life is peaceful as it is meant to be
where I stand full of wonder
while about me everything seems at ease and still
as if in this part of the world you can do, as you will
and my heart is silent full of tranquilly
as if in this place there is no iniquity
where I stand full of wonder.

Will You Walk With Me Rondeau 

Will you walk with me, up the staircase of our life;
At the top, can I hold your hands and call you wife?
I will walk with you! Iâ€™ll bring comfort along the way.
I will pick flowers and give you many a bouquet.
My shoulders are broad, to bear your every strife,
And to your contentment, I dedicate my life.
This love is abundant and will always be rife.
So what is your answer. My darling, what do you say,
Will you walk with me?
Babe, Iâ€™ll give you kisses â€“ The elixir of life,
I will be a man, and treat you right - as my wife!
Today the moon is full, but it will be part one day,
The seasons change, but forever by your side Iâ€™ll stay.

and tells me that it ill beseems

However, by your blood, and grace I ace the test,

Sapphic Fragment 

Do I still long for my virginity?
Fragment 107
I never longed for my virginity.
I heard it on the radio after the hurricane.
There, in the aftermath, was the voice of a manâ€”
once the sweet, screwed-up boy whose hooded,
jessed spirit I tried to possess with the ruthlessness
I mistook for power. Here he was on NPR,
so gentle, so familiar with devastation,
his timbre woke the teenage falconer in me
who once saw his kindness as weakness,
saw a boy as an unfledged goshawkâ€”
a creature to trap and be trapped with
in darkened mews. I knew the rules:
neither of us could sleep until the molting bird
grew ravenous enough to take the raw mouse
from my hand. Breaking the falcon
broke us both, left us scared
and less aware ofâ€‰ love than fear.

men came to claim me, stone by stone,
â€˜From this day forward', I was told,
â€˜You're mine alone.'
From time to time a robin thought
by fighting fiercer than the rest

his own sweet nest.
Throughout all this Dame Fortune knew
but never gave the game away
that I am hers and it proved true
for she does stay.

Oh how that smile doth beguile me
From lips that whisper I love thee.

Feeling warmth and sensual charms

In music his thoughts may now rest content
For all is done; silent his dreams consent
To dance once more in the poetic muse

Trees push his innocent pure spirit into the breeze.
Dance nurtures the flower to put her into a  trance,
Trance is his way to gather pollen freely to dance.

Gleams of dawn in the sky are his love powerful dreams.

Arms are his wings when he searches for some different charms.

And his nature he decided to show.
He came from the north - forty miles, at least
Found his way through shirt, sweeter and coat

A loverâ€™s
Unerring cold tears
Flowing down

By the unsolved longing heart

That can fly only for love
Always, foreverâ€¦.

Shi Goes Mum When I Say 

I miss you more, it's winters again,
Heat is fading, flowers are blooming
Days gone shorter, I work at nights
You never come by, I keep waiting,
Holding hands, those sweet nothings.
Long phone calls, till either went sleeping
Clutching to memories, Shi.... says Move On..
Why, How, with whom, tell me Come On..
I'm not rich, but I have the riches,
My feelings are real, there ain't any glitches,
Stop it, go away, Will You...

Shi On A Theme By Whitman 

They have to call it something
They'll pick some dead Latin word, or bastardize Greek and Chinese into one
Call it cat shit for all I care
I get it
Must be on the cutting-edge;
The future approaches no faster-
And now we're postmodern?
Where'd now go? How'd I miss modern?
It went right past me?
Some want you to do it
Some want me to do it
Well they should go buy some pens and do it themselves(or else I'll just do both)
-But it's like your first time making love;
Feel- and hope it goes where you want

use the mouse to satisfy the muse of your love!

For this love is like the muse of a beautiful flower;

A Thursday evening unforgettable,
Six months in total, it took.

Thou lousy place, thy heavenly presence,
I couldn't believe, how could my neighbours! !
Brought to life, all Shi.... touch,
Thy water bottle now means so much! !
Cheek so meek, , hair so well layered, lips so crisp, white nose turned rose! !

Complain or compliment, smile or frown,
wondering the next time Shi.... will be in town! !

On Sijo Writing 

The first line is a full skirt,
the second is the bodice;
On reaching the third and last
the neat collar has been added.
Lightly tie the ribbon bow,
and the charm of the dress will appear.
The basic pattern of fours
is like the counting of the days:
Twenty-eight will make a month,
thirty-one, too, will make a month.
Set the stern, and when leaves and flowers bloom
fragrance will come of itself.
The bright moon lighting up the sky,
clear and white above the ground,
Is it just the shining soul
of the sijo of ancient masters?
The mere sound of a lute in moonlight
is that not a sijo too?

6th Period Slam 

Sixth period is such a bore
Makes every breathe I take even seem like a chore
While the girl behind me starts to snore,
How I would love to just run out the door.
The teacher says, 'We're learning something new! '
I clasp my face in my hands and say 'Boo Hoo'
This class makes my heart go blue,
I ignore the lesson and try to find something else to do.
This poem wasn't meant to have a reason
Just express my thoughts in this senioritis season
Writing this way isn't treason,
You're not some I have to please, go on!
But back to my thoughts
Listening to the lesson, maybe I 'ought,
Although really, I doubt I'd learn a lot,
If anything, I'd just get annoyed and distraught.
When does the long awaited bell ring?
That sets me free and makes me want to sing?
To get out of this room, I am dying,
Oh, I'd do anything to hear that bing, bing, bing!

Doors That Slam 

Doors that slam and shut real tight
usually happen after the fight.
Behind those doors tears do drop,
taking their time before they stop.
After they've dried and calm's prevailed
you wonder why it is that you failed
to recognize how you let tears creep
into your eyes that made you weep.
Surely this scene you've had before.
Stubborness and pride slammed that door.
The emotions of love get all mixed in.
It's then that your head goes into a spin.
But down deep inside what made you cry
is the ego you own and that is why
you are more than ego. You are all heart.
The door you slammed tore your own heart apart.

You let it all rest on a paper thin promise
But tonight you'll go out with hope, a reported sighting of elusive hope
The same type of hope that leads people to believe in that w
hich they cannot see and cannot touch and cannot sense in any other way
My friends had to carry you out
An arm over each victorious shoulder
Alive with the dual camaraderie of violence and tribal connection
And in the pit you felt alive
Egged on by posers standing on the outside
In those days, nobody got their fun from deliberate harm
Six poor youths sharing an all you can eat salad bar
Sweaty, drunk, no bad impressions of the world have formed in their heads
None of them deserve lives that will be diametrically opposed to tonight
If we had an example who was neither a man nor a woman
Jean wore a half-moon shirt and was instantly emulated
This place is sometimes used as a gym during the day and Jean is the only one visible from the bleachers
Relate to a scene whose worth was endangered from conception
Will one day disappear and be remembered in documentaries
Jean, did you not exist in the cold, hard light of serious self-reliance?

Slam It Not
Rondel Or Roundel Poetry
January 3, 2020
Slam it not, you angry guys!
It can hit you at back and thigh
See the case, low or high?
Or, merely it is a simple pie;
At low case you do your best
At high case you do investigate,
Slam it not, you angry guys!
It can hit you at back and thigh;
At final gate you arrange a test
On moderate asking is the best
Then you'll find the right in fact,
Slam it not, you angry guys!
It can hit you at back and thigh.

Slam 

To Slam a Door it really does show
How 'Little', Angry people do know,
About the feelings of folks like Us
They just Shout, Slam and Cuss
To Slam a Door it's not the end
But it does drive me around the Bend
Here I sit, all in Tears
Holding my hands over my Ears
To close a Door Soft and Sweet
These people I like to meet
They take care say: 'hallo' and 'goodbye'
Them angry 'f$%^&*ers' need a punch in the 'eye'

I have given up hope again
Im on the floor in my bathroom again
Theres a can in my hand again
And I slam it against my thigh again
Again and again I want a bruise
Soon im curled up in a ball again
Nearly an adult yet curled against a radiator terrified again
I regret it again
Promise not to do it again
I tell a lie again

Slam 

As I sit and cry
Hear voices yelling
I hear screaming
The door slam
It`s quiet to silent
Like the world stopped
I hear my tears drop
Why do I go through this?
Did they hear my tears drop?
Did they hear the door slam?
I wish they would just stop
And listen to me
Here I am sitting hear
Crying with pain
Can anyone make them stop?
I can`t take it anymore please just stop
Youâ€™re tearing me apart
As I sit and cry I hear vices yelling
And the door slam

The New Slam

After a snooze
The stranger began to sneeze
It made a sudden burst out
Of sharp sound,
Though the sound broke the longer silence of the room
It caused asking him
A lot of questions
Of harsh and fun,

Or, chess!
It's evening
Prayer time
Why a game?
Let's do something for means, name and fame.

Things I Know By Heart Slam Poetry 

1.	How hard I cross my fingers when I'm headed home. Every t
ime. It's like a bad habit, the hoping, the wishing. I need to stop wishing.
2.	That your hair is always messy. Don't worry, I like it th
at way. It makes you look like an electric shock, alive, ch
aotic. It spells out exactly how much of your life you've lived, not just existed.
3.	The awkward greetings I give you when we pass, trying to 
pierce through a perfect day, but they always fall flat or quiet.
4.	You mean all your compliments, but the most you do is mea
n them. They are not a gift to you, or reaching out in the dark. They are words.
5.	But you always know just what to say to me.
6.	I overthink your words.
7.	I overthink my words.
8.	I overthink everything.
9.	How you almost fall backwards out of chairs every time yo
u laugh. Without fail. It's like you're falling for something other than me.
10.	When I walk into a room, I look for an empty seat next t
o you just so I can trick myself into thinking you're inching closer to me. It's always my chair moving.
11.	The way the minutes sprint by in the early morning, coun
tless nights where at 4am you'll say you're not tired and a
n hour later I have to drag you out so you don't do anythin
g you'll regret. You're falling asleep the whole time but they're still the best nights I've had in a while.
12.	Your favorite song. Correction: your favorite songs. Eve
ry time one of them comes on and I can feel your eyes light
 up before I even look at you, I add it to a list of things
 to listen to harder. I want to know them better than I know you.
13.	That no matter how far away you are I can still feel you
 moving like chains or a marionette string. Maybe you have dark magic. I don't really care. I love black holes.
14.	I need to end this list before I add you to it, because 
I don't know you by heart I don't know you by heart I want to know you by heart by hands by head by everything
15.	You, someday.
16.	How hard I cross my fingers when I'm headed to you. Ever
y time. It's like a bad habit, the hoping, the wishing. I need to stop wishing.
17.	I will never stop wishing.

Tongue Twister Slam Poetry 

there's almost too much of a tongue twister in your name,
roof of my mouth soiled with the aftertaste,
spilling rivers into footsteps flaring imprints on the forest floor,
framing what I thought I could reforget
and I've told you not to attack this tongue,
manipulate this marvelous,
teeth thrown into a whirlwind
before you understand me,
crack this crumbling code and remember
you could become as much mine as my heartbeat,
this could be breathing but it feels like so much more than that,
like I don't have to think here,
kick the dust up behind you before you realize the road's paved,
memorize the click of my copper-cut fists,
and every time I turn around and see you like this
it's like
(inhale)
I don't realize I've been holding my breath.

Winter Slam 

Got bright and sunny
Went from cool to hot,
Just when Spring was here
Then it was not;
Winter slammed the
Door again. Even now
Another stormâ€™s
Coming in,
Rain and lots of it.
And of course I had
Just washed the car.
Weather just so bizarre.
Shorts and thongs
Didnâ€™t last long
Now I need a sweater
Till the temps get better
Because again it is cold, as
Winter takes another shot.
Really thought Spring had
Arrived, but, I guess not.

Amazingly, out went the mark
And wiped off all shed tears

A Memory From A Sonnet Sequence 

Somewhile before the dawn I rose, and stept
Softly along the dim way to your room,
And found you sleeping in the quiet gloom,
And holiness about you as you slept.
I knelt there; till your waking fingers crept
About my head, and held it.  I had rest
Unhoped this side of Heaven, beneath your breast.
I knelt a long time, still; nor even wept.
It was great wrong you did me; and for gain
Of that poor moment's kindliness, and ease,
And sleepy mother-comfort!
Child, you know
How easily love leaps out to dreams like these,
Who has seen them true.  And love that's wakened so
Takes all too long to lay asleep again.

His Last Sonnet 

Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art! -
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night,
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like Nature's patient sleepless Eremite,
The moving waters at their priestlike task
Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,
Or gazing on the new soft fallen mask
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors -
No -yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,
Pillowed upon my fair love's ripening breast,
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
And so live ever -or else swoon to death.

Holy Sonnet Ii As Due By Many Titles 

As due by many titles I resigne
My selfe to thee, O God, first I was made
By thee, and for thee, and when I was decay'd
Thy blood bought that, the which before was thine;
I am thy sonne, made with thy selfe to shine,
Thy servant, whose paines thou hast still repaid,
Thy sheepe, thine Image, and, till I betray'd
My selfe, a temple of thy Spirit divine;
Why doth the devill then usurpe on mee?
Why doth he steale, nay ravish that's thy right?
Except thou rise and for thine own worke fight,
Oh I shall soone despaire, when I doe see
That thou lov'st mankind well, yet wilt'not chuse me,
And Satan hates mee, yet is loth to lose me.

Holy Sonnet Iii O Might Those Sighes 

O might those sighes and teares returne againe
Into my breast and eyes, which I have spent,
That I might in this holy discontent
Mourne with some fruit, as I have mourn'd in vaine;
In mine Idolatry what showres of raine
Mine eyes did waste? what griefs my heart did rent?
That sufferance was my sinne; now I repent;
'Cause I did sufffer I must suffer paine.
Th'hydroptique drunkard, and night-scouting thiefe,
The itchy Lecher, and selfe-tickling proud
Have the remembrance of past joyes, for reliefe
Of comming ills. To (poore) me is allow'd
No ease; for, long, yet vehement griefe hath beene
Th'effect and cause, the punishment and sinne.

Thou hast made me, and shall thy work decay?
Repair me now, for now mine end doth haste;

And all my pleasures are like yesterday.
I dare not move my dim eyes any way,
Despair behind, and death before doth cast
Such terror, and my feeble flesh doth waste
By sin in it, which it towards hell doth weigh.
Only thou art above, and when towards thee
By thy leave I can look, I rise again;
But our old subtle foe so tempteth me
That not one hour myself I can sustain.
Thy grace may wing me to prevent his art,
And thou like adamant draw mine iron heart.

Or like a thief, which till death's doom be read,
Wisheth himself delivered from prison,
But damned and haled to execution,
Wisheth that still he might be imprisoned.
Yet grace, if thou repent, thou canst not lack;
But who shall give thee that grace to begin?
Oh make thy self with holy mourning black,
And red with blushing, as thou art with sin;
Or wash thee in Christ's blood, which hath this might
That being red, it dyes red souls to white.

Blood fills his frownes, which from his pierc'd head fell.
And can that tongue adjudge thee unto hell,
Which pray'd forgiveness for his foes fierce spight?
No, no; but as in my idolatrie

On one, on seven, or on no hill appear?
Dwells she with us, or like adventuring knights
First travail we to seek and then make love?

To Nature, and to hers, and my good is dead,
And her soul early into heaven ravished,
Wholly on heavenly things my mind is set.
here the admiring her my mind did whet
To seek thee, God; so streams do show the head;
But though I have found thee, and thou my thirst hast fed,
a holy thristy dropsy melts me yet.
But why should I beg more love, whenas thou
Dost woo my soul, for hers offering all thine:
And dost not only fear lest I allow
My love to saints and angels, things divine,
but in they tender jealousy dost doubt
lest the world, flesh, yea, devil put thee out.

And still begetting, (for he ne'r begonne)
Hath deign'd to chuse thee by adoption,
Coheire to his glory, and Sabbaths endlesse rest;

His stolne stuffe sold, must lose or buy it againe;

Scorn Not The Sonnet 

Scorn not the Sonnet; Critic, you have frowned,
Mindless of its just honours; with this key
Shakspeare unlocked his heart; the melody
Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's wound;
A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound;
With it Camoens soothed an exile's grief;
The Sonnet glittered a gay myrtle leaf
Amid the cypress with which Dante crowned
His visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp,
It cheered mild Spenser, called from Faery-land
To struggle through dark ways; and when a damp
Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand
The Thing became a trumpet; whence he blew
Soul-animating strains--alas, too few!

Sonnet Ciii 

Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,
That having such a scope to show her pride,
The argument all bare is of more worth
Than when it hath my added praise beside!
O, blame me not, if I no more can write!
Look in your glass, and there appears a face
That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.
Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,
To mar the subject that before was well?
For to no other pass my verses tend
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
And more, much more, than in my verse can sit
Your own glass shows you when you look in it.

Sonnet Cii 

My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;
I love not less, though less the show appear:
That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
Our love was new and then but in the spring
When I was wont to greet it with my lays,
As Philomel in summer's front doth sing
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
Not that the summer is less pleasant now
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
But that wild music burthens every bough
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue,
Because I would not dull you with my song.

Sonnet Ci 

O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
So dost thou too, and therein dignified.
Make answer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say
'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;
Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;
But best is best, if never intermix'd?'
Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,
And to be praised of ages yet to be.
Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how
To make him seem long hence as he shows now.

O, never say that I was false of heart,
Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.
As easy might I from myself depart
As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:
That is my home of love: if I have ranged,
Like him that travels I return again,
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
So that myself bring water for my stain.
Never believe, though in my nature reign'd
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
That it could so preposterously be stain'd,
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
For nothing this wide universe I call,
Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.

Sonnet Cliv 

The little Love-god lying once asleep
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
The fairest votary took up that fire
Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
And so the general of hot desire
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,
Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.

O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
That in the very refuse of thy deeds
There is such strength and warrantize of skill
That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?

With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:
If thy unworthiness raised love in me,

In gentle numbers time so idly spent;
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,

Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
I must, each day say o'er the very same,
Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.
So that eternal love in love's fresh case
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
But makes antiquity for aye his page,
Finding the first conceit of love there bred
Where time and outward form would show it dead.

Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,

Suppos'd as forfeit to a confin'd doom.
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
Now with the drops of this most balmy time
My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,
Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes;
And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.

Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
Still constant in a wondrous excellence;
Therefore my verse to constancy confined,
One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
'Fair, kind and true' is all my argument,
'Fair, kind, and true' varying to other words;
And in this change is my invention spent,
Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
'Fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,
Which three till now never kept seat in one.

Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
In the distraction of this madding fever!
O benefit of ill! now I find true
That better is by evil still made better;
And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,
Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
So I return rebuked to my content
And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.

Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
To follow that which flies before her face,

So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;
But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,

That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,
Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.

And worse essays proved thee my best of love.

With eager compounds we our palate urge,

Even so, being tuff of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding
And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
To be diseased ere that there was true needing.
Thus policy in love, to anticipate
The ills that were not, grew to faults assured
And brought to medicine a healthful state
Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:
But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,
Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.

Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove:
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is the star to every wandering bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle's compass come:
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
If this be error and upon me proved,
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,

Save one that faith deciphered in the skies;
To trust the soul's invincible surmise
Was all his science and his only art.
Our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine
That lights the pathway but one step ahead
Across a void of mystery and dread.
Bid, then, the tender light of faith to shine
By which alone the mortal heart is led
Unto the thinking of the thought divine.

And now you're mine. Rest with your dream in my dream.
Love and pain and work should all sleep, now.
The night turns on its invisible wheels,
and you are pure beside me as a sleeping amber.
No one else, Love, will sleep in my dreams. You will go,
we will go together, over the waters of time.
No one else will travel through the shadows with me,
only you, evergreen, ever sun, ever moon.
Your hands have already opened their delicate fists
and let their soft drifting signs drop away; your eyes closed like two gray
wings, and I move
after, following the folding water you carry, that carries
me away. The night, the world, the wind spin out their destiny.
Without you, I am your dream, only that, and that is all.

for the worm of my despair.
If you are my hidden treasure,

and adorn the branches of your river

I am in need of music that would flow
Over my fretful, feeling finger-tips,
Over my bitter-tainted, trembling lips,
With melody, deep, clear, and liquid-slow.
Oh, for the healing swaying, old and low,
Of some song sung to rest the tired dead,
A song to fall like water on my head,
And over quivering limbs, dream flushed to glow!
There is a magic made by melody:
A spell of rest, and quiet breath, and cool
Heart, that sinks through fading colors deep
To the subaqueous stillness of the sea,
And floats forever in a moon-green pool,
Held in the arms of rhythm and of sleep.

The priests who call upon thy name are slain,
Dost thou not hear the bitter wail of pain
From those whose children lie upon the stones?
Come down, O Son of God! incestuous gloom
Curtains the land, and through the starless night

That have a double life, which thus is made
A type of that twin entity which springs
From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.
There is a two-fold Silence- sea and shore-
Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,
Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,
Some human memories and tearful lore,
Render him terrorless: his name's "No More."
He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!
No power hath he of evil in himself;
But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,
That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
No foot of man,) commend thyself to God!

Gin and chicken helpless in her Irish hand,
Irresistible as Rabelais but most tender for
The lame dogs and hurt birds that surround her,â€”
She is a procession no one can follow after
But be like a little dog following a brass band.
She will not glance up at the bomber or condescend
To drop her gin and scuttle to a cellar,
But lean on the mahogany table like a mountain
Whom only faith can move, and so I send
O all her faith and all my love to tell her
That she will move from mourning into morning.

Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine
With pulses that beat double. What I do

To climb Aornus, and can scarce avail
To pipe now 'gainst the valley nightingale

To these things? O BelovÃ¨d, it is plain

From myself.. me.. that I should bring thee proof,
In words of love hid in me...out of reach.

May be unwrought so. Neither love me for

'I love her for her smile--her look--her way
Of speaking gently,--for a trick of thought
That falls in well with mine, and certes brought
A sense of pleasant ease on such a day'--
For these things in themselves, Beloved, may
Be changed, or change for thee,--and love, so wrought,
May be unwrought so. Neither love me for
Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry,--
A creature might forget to weep, who bore
Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby !
But love me for love's sake, that evermore
Thou mayst love on, through love's eternity.
END
Elizabeth Barrett Browning

Sonnet Xliii 

How do I love thee ? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of everyday's
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,--I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life !--and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death.
END

Sonnet Xli I Thank All 

I thank all who have loved me in their hearts,
With thanks and love from mine. Deep thanks to all
Who paused a little near the prison-wall
To hear my music in its louder parts
Ere they went onward, each one to the mart's
Or temple's occupation, beyond call.
But thou, who, in my voice's sink and fall
When the sob took it, thy divinest Art's
Own instrument didst drop down at thy foot
To hearken what I said between my tears,...
Instruct me how to thank thee! Oh, to shoot
My soul's full meaning into future years,
That they should lend it utterance, and salute
Love that endures, from Life that disappears!

Sonnet Xviii Shall I Compare Thee To A Summers Day 

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this and this gives life to thee.
END
William Shakespeare

Sonnet Xxii When Our Two Souls Stand Up 

When our two souls stand up erect and strong,
Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,
Until the lengthening wings break into fire
At either curvÃ¨d point,--what bitter wrong
Can the earth do to us, that we should not long
Be here contented? Think. In mounting higher,
The angels would press on us and aspire
To drop some golden orb of perfect song
Into our deep, dear silence. Let us stay
Rather on earth, BelovÃ¨d,--where the unfit
Contrarious moods of men recoil away
And isolate pure spirits, and permit
A place to stand and love in for a day,
With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.
END
Elizabeth Barrett Browning

Sonnet Xxxviii First Time He Kissed Me 

First time he kissed me, he but only kissed
The finger of this hand wherewith I write;
And ever since, it grew more clean and white,
Slow to world-greetings, quick with its "Oh, list,"
When the angels speak. A ring of amethyst
I could not wear here, plainer to my sight,
Than that first kiss. The second passed in height
The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed,
Half falling on the hair. O beyond meed!
That was the chrism of love, which love's own crown,
With sanctifying sweetness, did precede.
The third upon my lips was folded down
In perfect, purple state; since when, indeed,
I have been proud and said, "My love, my own."
END

The Sonnet 

A sonnet is a moment's monument, --
Memorial from the Soul's eternity
To one dead deathless hour. Look that it be,
Whether for lustral rite or dire portent,
Of its own arduous fulness reverent:
Carve it in ivory or in ebony,
As Day or Night may rule; and let Time see
Its flowering crest impearled and orient.
A Sonnet is a coin: its face reveals
The soul, -- its converse, to what Power 'tis due: --
Whether for tribute to the august appeals
Of Life, or dower in Love's high retinue,
It serve, or, 'mid the dark wharf's cavernous breath,
In Charon's palm it pay the toll of Death.
END
Dante Gabriel Rossetti

To Haydon With A Sonnet Written On Seeing The Elgin Marbles 

Haydon! forgive me that I cannot speak
Definitively of these mighty things;
Forgive me, that I have not eagle's wings,
That what I want I know not where to seek,
And think that I would not be over-meek,
In rolling out upfollowed thunderings,
Even to the steep of Heliconian springs,
Were I of ample strength for such a freak.
Think, too, that all these numbers should be thine;
Whose else? In this who touch thy vesture's hem?
For, when men stared at what was most divine
With brainless idiotism and o'erwise phlegm,
Thou hadst beheld the full Hesperian shine
Of their star in the east, and gone to worship them!
END
John Keats

A Stanza On Freedom 

THEY are slaves who fear to speak
For the fallen and the weak;
They are slaves who will not choose
Hatred, scoffing, and abuse,
Rather than in silence shrink
From the truth they needs must think;
They are slaves who dare not be
In the right with two or three.

Black And Red Rose Stanza 

The world is the vast garden of roses
Every moment a blooms and a falls
One laughs and other cries
Beside the empty stalks;
Yet my friend asks
Whether I am fond of red or black ones,
I see both bloom in the garden
In name and qualities are same
Only color is different
Yet I face the question.

By The Shore Stanza Nine 

Slack water. The tide turns
A ripple in the undergrowth.
The Eagle now abandons
His suspended silence
As wings fold and the waves
Fold over the level shore.
Drake's drum beats
In my brow its Alexandrines
Calls up my quixotic being.
And who is she, my metronome,
Stilettos clicking on the prom?
I turn again as does the tide
To meet a glancing eye.
There is no pain in dreaming!

Haiku105 Whispering Love In Haiku Stanza 

The religion game
only one right way; there can
be only the one.
Fear haunts such small minds
seeing through their broken glass,
blind leading the blind.
No heaven no hell

The Spirit indwells
beyond the understanding.
A whispering Love
whose strength surrounds us,
guides us along each day; just what

But if they learn and it is very remarkable how quickly they learn

Stanza Written At Bracknell 

Thy dewy looks sink in my breast;
Thy gentle words stir poison there;

The chains that bind this ruined soul
Had cankered thenâ€”but crushed it not.

The Baya Weavers Nest Stanza 

With some ordinary straws, blades of grasses and leaves
Applying wonderful skills, techniques and strategies
The pair happily weave a beautiful nest,
With a door, hollow inside, much soft and fantastic to look at;
This small nest is as their hut
Loving each other they set their dreamy, longing world
Full of muse, ecstasy, sensuousness and expectation
Centralizing which round the two lives' wheels best;
Two eggs the mother bird lays
Father and mother both sit on the eggs,
Soon the two chicks come out of the hard shell of eggs
Raising head to the sky they open their beaks
That makes inside the tender mouths cute gap for food,
Collecting food hurriedly the parents return to put the first food
In the young chicks' adorable mouths
And caress, dandle, fondle uttering loving sounds, "aan, aan".

Watching the gardens
Full with charming flowers;

Time In Division And Multiplication Stanza 

The seven days of each week are coming by turns
As a great system of night and day and time division,
One day is divided by a certain number
Again multiplied by a certain number
To get certain division and multiplication of time,
In our world day is the great unit of time
Hour, minute and second are the division of day
Month, week, year and century are the multiplication of day,
Some regional alternatives of day and night exist
As, in the two poles, a 24 hours, sunny or dark a day is fixed.

For the venerable host of Poetrhy Unplugged for all the smil

Issa has a haiku wherein he implores the mist to hide his vi

A Basketball Tercet 

Yes, everyone must have a basketball.
It's the gift that must be given to all,
Because with it, everyone can have a ball.
You can bump it to touch the sky;
Something all want to do before they die.
Best of all, it is very easy to dry.
You can use just one sheet of bounty;
Water runs off it like pretty girls run from me;
By the way, that is something you ought to see!
Just pump it and you will have a best friend,
A classy one, if you are willing to spend;
You can get a warranty that does not end.
Spalding is the brand used by the NBA,
It makes for one hell of a play,
But you do not have to take what I say.
Try it for yourself and you will see,
A basketball is a friend without animosity.
Get one! If I were you, I would do so quickly.

There sat the featured tokenâ€”
All quiet and unspoken.
Perfect harmony did abound;

Every day I sit in the cafÃ© and think of you
Over a glass of iced coffee and doughnut
Our love was so sweet gentle and true
Every day I sit in the cafÃ© and think of you
You walked away out of my life making me blue
Now I watch young girls walk by flouncing their strut
Every day I sit in the cafÃ© and think of you
Over a glass of iced coffee and doughnut

Easy Is The Triolet 

Easy is the Triolet,
If you really learn to make it!
Once a neat refrain you get,
Easy is the Triolet.
As you see! I pay my debt
With another rhyme, Deuce take it,
Easy is the Triolet,
If you really learn to make it!

Embers Triolet 

The kiss of twilight comes too soon
Sun's dying embers faintly glow
Dusk's fair cape now heralds the moon
The kiss of twilight comes too soon
And lovers emerge to caress and swoon
Nature finds its bed in the hedgerow
The kiss of twilight comes too soon
Sun's dying embers faintly glow

Far Away In The Blue Triolet 

As far away as the blue

as far away as the blue
where the sun touches the hillocks.

Farewell To Love Triolet 

Bid farewell to loves embrace

Bid farewell to loves embrace
End of such passion, fire and heat

Farmer Triolet 

We eat food daily not giving a thought
how grown in fields, who have sweated.
Get in kitchen simply think, have bought;

Farmers grow things by working so hard
just give everything to us, self bear fret.
We eat food daily not giving a thought
how grown in fields, who have sweated.

Fields Of Corn Triolet 

I walk in loneliness through fields of corn
Caressing the corn with my hand as I stroll

For I lost my sweet love now love is forlorn
She has taken everything even my very soul
I walk in loneliness through fields of corn
Caressing the corn with my hand as I stroll

Flawed Democracy Triolet 

A flawed democracy exists
When laws are mere words on paper.

Then evil reigns, drunk with power.
A flawed democracy exists
When laws are mere words on paper.

Flute A Triolet 

Hollow and holes of bamboo played with air.
Most natural, magical, musical instrument.

In tranquillity, ears sense celestial experience.
Hollow and holes of bamboo played with air;
Most natural, magical, musical instrument.

Who would have known that love could leave
And pain the heart that trusted so?

Who would have known that love could leave
And pain the heart that trusted so?

Love Is A Palace Triolet 

Love is a palace that's so far away,
We ride there on horses nobody has seen;
Leaped over their paddock and then went astray,
Love is a palace that's so far away.

On wild horses we go where we've never yet been;
Love is a palace that's so far away,
We ride there on horses nobody has seen.

And that is the way it is so
Be aware all the time that yes

At times we have lots some times less
And with it just reap what we sow
Money comes and money goes
And that is the way it is so

Keep life simple rid of excess
If you don't want more debts now
Money comes and money goes
And that is the way it is so.

But if you die I must rush to check the blood
Or else I will also die, silently.

Dance of romance to a lyrical theme,

Journeying With Love Triversen 

Your smile silently swayed me its way;
My head guided by your voluptuous pull,
My days and nights passed as a blur.
We traversed many a raging river,
Whose waters flooded the feet that followed,
But I never noticed the wetness.
We climbed till we were in the clouds;
We maneuvered massive mountains,
But I am yet to see a hill.
We journeyed to hell-hot deserts,
Where life left with children and the bag,
But I am yet to feel the heat.
We dived to the darkest of oceans
Where the only lights were our hearts,
But love always lit the way.
I find peace in the green of your eyes.
The love that blooms, that I see in them,
Takes my worries, erases my pain.

garrotter thug who strangles the money from your wallets in the night, your
goat of sacrifice or should that be the dragon. They should take them to the Tyburn tree is what my friend said to
me, would you have them atop the Tyburn, canâ€™t you see the injustice of that
tree, you could when the blood reigned, but it reigns still. They should take
them to the Tyburn tree, is what my neighbour said to me, love thy neighbour
does not existed from what I can see, their just rulers encapsulated by theatre,
and if you are a Wakefield hang man it is no comfort to those condemned.
They should take them to the Tyburn tree, another victim of ill society.

Advice To The Grub Street Verse Writers 

Ye poets ragged and forlorn,
Down from your garrets haste;
Ye rhymers, dead as soon as born,
Not yet consign'd to paste;
I know a trick to make you thrive;
O, 'tis a quaint device:
Your still-born poems shall revive,
And scorn to wrap up spice.
Get all your verses printed fair,
Then let them well be dried;
And Curll must have a special care
To leave the margin wide.
Lend these to paper-sparing Pope;
And when he sets to write,
No letter with an envelope
Could give him more delight.
When Pope has fill'd the margins round,
Why then recall your loan;
Sell them to Curll for fifty pound,
And swear they are your own.

A Parody On Euripidess Lyric Verse 

Halcyons ye by the flowing sea
Waves that warble twitteringly,
Circling over the tumbling blue,
Dipping your down in its briny dew,
Spi-i-iders in corners dim
Spi-spi-spinning your fairy film,
Shuttles echoing round the room
Silver notes of the whistling loom,
Where the light-footed dolphin skips
Down the wake of the dark-prowed ships,
Over the course of the racing steed
Where the clustering tendrils breed
Grapes to drown dull care in delight,
Oh! mother make me a child again just for to-night!
I don't exactly see how that last line is to scan,
But that's a consideration I leave to our musical man.

A Touch Of Verse 

Light has exposed the landscape to its form.
Mood is rebuked of all its artifice.
Wind moves like winter through the naked trees.
I ask you for a leaf, but there is none.
Instead, you offer me a weather coat,
Gray as warm words reduced to whispering.
You tell me that November loves old bones.
Your frost accent is quite believable.
You paint a picture of our private sky.
The light falls faint upon my closing eyes.
Held close within a margin of rare words,
Stillness sings like a fragile, yellow bird.
Against the glass old memories ebb and flow.
A touch of verse becomes a touch of snow.
Our tiny world is slipping into space.
Only your precious hands hold it in place.

and there is no way into your vision
unless I somehow warm you up first
Alas, that is something I can't do
unless you're willing to let yourself go
and press your body against my body
in hopes that the sparks will make a fire
So until our bones lie in the ground

and it is burning like Andromeda
just because you aren't here for me
but I wonder, if you come around
will I want to burn for you much more?

Empires A Free Verse Poem 

Empires are like the vast waves
Upon a never ending ocean of time
They start off humbly before rising
Out of the gloom of their origins.
Forever reaching up towards the
Sacred searing light of the heavens
Searching for a promise of power
That is never found, or fully realized.
Those that bare witness to it can
Only marvel at itâ€™s sheer decadence
And itâ€™s raw, unlimited power which
Drives itâ€™s endless, unsatisfied greed.
As quickly as it appeared it sinks away
Into the oblivion of the darkness which
Gave it birth, only for another to follow
In its wake, thus the cycle goes ever on.

For A Lady Who Must Write Verse 

Unto seventy years and seven,
Hide your double birthright well-
You, that are the brat of Heaven
And the pampered heir to Hell.
Let your rhymes be tinsel treasures,
Strung and seen and thrown aside.
Drill your apt and docile measures
Sternly as you drill your pride.
Show your quick, alarming skill in
Tidy mockeries of art;
Never, never dip your quill in
Ink that rushes from your heart.
When your pain must come to paper,
See it dust, before the day;
Let your night-light curl and caper,
Let it lick the words away.
Never print, poor child, a lay on
Love and tears and anguishing,
Lest a cooled, benignant Phaon
Murmur, "Silly little thing!"

From Mad To Verse 

(Old note on the day Ogden Nash cached in.)
Jabberwock, ode to a skylark,
he'd used any device (licit or il)
slyly to entice words to a lip tease;
that harlequin in word-paint on a stanzaic trapeze,
slapstick Houdini of phonetic cajolery
hocus-pocused versentences into breathless, paragraph-long forced (Holy Moly)
marches until they began to huff and puff, then yank them somersaulting
into rhyme-ribbing drollery.
Alas and alack, from mad to worsa,
his quipster's pen stalled, smack in mid-snicker,
candy still dandy and liquor quicker,
that clanging prankster,
that tricktionary, syntaxical most-wanted gangsta
bequeathed us pun-ditry of snigger and flashery-
crackerjack, whip-snap, impish, funny-boned, taffy-pull
Ogden Nashery.

From This City I Want To Escape Free Verse Quatern 

From this city I want to flee,
to find a place of some solace,

where city lights sometimes blind people.
I still think about how it was,
from this city I want to flee,
I cannot fit in this anthill,
a bridge to escape, I must find.
The city makes me uneasy,
I want to wander on the beach,
from this city I want to flee,
I want to vanish by bus or train.
Now I splash in a city stream,
at times are in the open air,
about freedom I can just dream,
from this city I want to flee.

Ive Lost One Verse With Tinkling Lines 

Iâ€™ve lost one verse
With tinkling lines,
Iâ€™ve lost a verse,
Itâ€™s somewhere elseâ€¦
I sought the leaf,
But couldnâ€™t find,
Even from the disc
It vanished.
I cried and cried
For that little verse,
In my soul it lay
Like a winged word,
It lay there
Like grief and anguish.
That bright and sincere thought â€“
That verse remained in the past.
Iâ€™m tired of grief and sorrow,
Sorrow has seized me at lastâ€¦

I Who Live Though I Have Died Verse Xxvi 

I who live though I have died,
Claim a great discovery,
For last night I verified
Love is the best remedy.
When weighed by the cross, a man
Resolves to die for the right;
He does all the good he can,
And returns bathed in the light.
XXVI-YO QUE VIVO AUNQUE ME HE MUERTO...
Yo que vivo, aunque me he muerto,
Soy un gran descubridor,
Porque anoche he descubierto
La medicina de amor.
Cuando al peso de la cruz
El hombre morir resuelve,
Sale a hacer bien, lo hace, y vuelve
Como de un baÃ±o de luz.

Last Verse Of Bismil 

What's the use hats off, when the person died,
What's the use of message which came after tide.
When hopes were dead & died every thought,
What's the use of message if the messenger brought.
O Heart! go away from here and destroy thy notion,
What's the use of it if thou did after motion.
Alas! had we seen our goal alive,
What's the use of it, if achieved after life.
Worth seen were the last moments of 'Bismil',
What's the use if the people saw it after thrill.

Letter In Verse 

Like boys that run behind the loaded wain
For the mere joy of riding back again,
When summer from the meadow carts the hay
And school hours leave them half a day to play;
So I with leisure on three sides a sheet
Of foolscap dance with poesy's measured feet,
Just to ride post upon the wings of time
And kill a care, to friendship turned in rhyme.
The muse's gallop hurries me in sport
With much to read and little to divert,
And I, amused, with less of wit than will,
Run till I tire.--And so to cheat her still.
Like children running races who shall be
First in to touch the orchard wall or tree,
The last half way behind, by distance vext,
Turns short, determined to be first the next;
So now the muse has run me hard and long--
I'll leave at once her races and her song;
And, turning round, laugh at the letter's close
And beat her out by ending it in prose.

Light Years Of Verse 

Iambic pentameters of junk and rhyme
Each being a measurement of distance and not of time
Matters not to me
As I count the stars I find...
Traveling as lovers on a voyage
Into the vast blackness of space
Where all words are weightless
And we are freed from their gravity
To describe the loving warmth of the sun
As well as the absolute beauty of the moon
Reflected in our eyesâ€¦

Lost A Free Verse Poem 

From the pit of my coldness
You burn me with acid-filled glares
Like I am nothing but garbage left to go stale
Out here I have no shelter from the rain.
I wander hungrily through familiar streets
Looking for somewhere to belong
I am labelled as a leper amongst the sick
For you do not want to see or hear my pain.
As I stand in the doorway of my despair
I watch the world from itâ€™s shadows
I have become a phantom with no hope
For I have ran out of people to blame.

Loving In Truth And Fain In Verse My Love To Show 

Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,
That She, dear She, might take some pleasure of my pain,
â€”Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,
Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtainâ€”
I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe,
Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain,
Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburnt brain.
But words came halting forth, wanting Invention's stay;
Invention, Nature's child, fled step-dame Study's blows;
And others' feet still seemed but strangers in my way.
Thus, great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes,
Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spiteâ€”
"Fool!" said my Muse to me "look in thy heart, and write!"

Sonnet17 Who Will Believe My Verse In Time To Come 

Who will believe my verse in time to come
If it were filled with your most high deserts?
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:
If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
The age to come would say, "This poet lies,
Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces."
So should my papers, yellowed with their age,
Be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue,
And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,
And stretchÃ¨d metre of an antique song.
But were some child of yours alive that time,
You should live twice, in it and in my rhyme.

Sonnet76 Why Is My Verse So Barren Of New Pride 

Why is my verse so barren of new pride?
So far from variation or quick change?
Why with the time do I not glance aside
To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
Why write I still all one, ever the same,
And keep invention in a noted weed,
That every word doth almost tell my name,
Showing their birth and where they did proceed?
O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,
And you and love are still my argument;
So all my best is dressing old words new,
Spending again what is already spent.
For as the sun is daily new and old,
So is my love still telling what is told.

Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
Bound for the prize of all-too-precious you,
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write
Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
Giving him aid, my verse astonishÃ¨d.
He nor that affable familiar ghost
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
As victors of my silence cannot boast;
I was not sick of any fear from thence.
But when your countenance filled up his line,
Then lacked I matter, that enfeebled mine.

Go, wailing verse, the infants of my love,
Minerva-like, brought forth without a Mother:
Present the image of the cares I prove;
Witness your Father's grief exceeds all other.
Sigh out a story of her cruel deeds,
With interrupted accents of despair:
A monument that whosoever reads
May justly praise, and blame my loveless Fair.
Say her disdain hath dried up my blood,
And starved you, in succours still denying;
Press to her eyes, importune me some good;
Waken her sleeping pity with your crying.
Knock at that hard heart, beg till you have mov'd her,
And tell th'unkind how dearly I have lov'd her.

These sad neglected notes for her dear sake?
Why should I offer up onto her name
The sweetest sacrifice my youth can make?
Why should I strive to make her live for ever,
That never deigns to give me joy to live?
Why should m'afflicted Muse so much endeavor,
Such honor unto cruelty to give?
If her defects have purchas'd her this fame,
What should her virtues do, her smiles, her love?

Favors (I think) would sense quite overcome,
And that makes happy Lovers ever dumb.

MARK yon runnel how â€™tis flowing,

Of the Spring-blooms near it blowing
And the sunlight in it gleaming!
Where that shelving rock is spied,
There with a smooth warbling slide
It lapses down into a cool
And brimming, not oâ€™erflowing pool.
Then between its narrowâ€™d banks
Playing mellow gurgling pranks,
It gushes till a channelâ€™d stone
Gives it a more strenuous tone;
Or with an under-swirling spread
Over a wide pebbled bed
It bubbles with a gentle pleasure,
Ere some new mood change the measure:
Such a runnel typeth well
The sweet wild verse of â€˜Christabel;â€™
But what
The Wonder-World it warbles through?

Well is a Passion to the Market brought,
When such a treasure of advice is bought
With so much dross. And could'st thou me assure,
Each vice of mine should meet with such a cure,
I would sin oft, and on my guilty brow
Wear every misperfection that I ow,
Open and visible; I should not hide
But bring my faults abroad: to hear thee chide
In such a Note, and with a Quill so sage,
It Passion tunes, and calmes a Tempests rage.
Well I am charm'd, and promise to redress
What, without shrift, my follies doe confess
Against my self: wherefore let me intreat,
When I fly out in that distemper'd heat
Which frets me into fasts, thou wilt reprove
That froward spleen in Poetry and Love:
So though I lose my reason in such fits,
Thoul't rime me back again into my wits.

Verse By The Graveyard 

Past the graveyard down the road,
Lives or dies a man out cold
Every minute is a burning desire
For him to feel there's nothing higher.
Hope he knows is also despair,
The lie of the land begins to stare
Every minute is a burning desire
For him to feel there is nothing higher.
Will any hand rise from the many dead?
Maybe it's time to be quiet instead
Breath continues no more so
The dead is the living let the dying grow
The man with nothing in him to feel
A sorrow or regret meaningless to conceal
Yet every minute is a burning desire
For him to feel there's nothing higher!

Verse Making Was Least Of My Virtues 

Verse-making was least of my virtues: I viewed with despair
Wealth that never yet was but might be--all that verse-making were
If the life would but lengthen to wish, let the mind be laid bare.
So I said, "To do little is bad, to do nothing is worse"--
And made verse.
Love-making,--how simple a matter! No depths to explore,
No heights in a life to ascend! No disheartening Before,
No affrighting Hereafter,--love now will be love ever more.
So I felt "To keep silence were folly:"--all language above,
I made love.

White Light A Free Verse Poem 

My blood-shot eyes blink away existence
Unfamiliar voices roll through my brain
Gravityâ€™s unseen hands pull me to the earth
I find their spell far too charming to fight.
Awful bells start to toll in my head, they play
Their terrible tune of death, so seductively
A searing light of pure white beats at my face
As the tolling draws me closer to itâ€™s calling.
I ascend into a white tunnel shining above me
But my body stays on the cold, hard ground
Iâ€™m so free from the burden of my fleshy clothing
So naked and fragile, like a screaming newborn.
My heartâ€™s rhythmic beating calls to me longingly
I fall back into the warm sanctuary of my body
I take a breath and feel so blessed  to still be alive
But all I can think about is the searing white light.

That must be made to clink in chime,
A dainty thing's the Villanelle;
And if you wish to flute a spell,
Or ask a meeting 'neath the lime,
It serves its purpose passing well.
You must not ask of it the swell
Of organs grandiose and sublime--
A dainty thing's the Villanelle;
And, filled with sweetness, as a shell
Is filled with sound, and launched in time,
It serves its purpose passing well.
Still fair to see and good to smell
As in the quaintness of its prime,
A dainty thing's the Villanelle,

searching for what love really means,
will there ever be love between her and me?

Why should the cosmic status quo oblige?
A dilettante which canâ€™t make up its mind

Each entity must choose a single guise.
And yet, if talent lends itself to mime
and amateurs prefer to play around
why shouldnâ€™t universal law oblige?
I make no bones about my biased eyes
and view all faithful frauds as tantamount

Steer your ship towards the Bill's lightning tree
Sail safe to the bay, from the wind that roams

A wise one who remembers when we began -
Though she's all that's in memory it seems.
In love, to longing my heart has been damned.
To love - remove betrayal from the plan.
And if I falter heart noisily screams.
I never thought I would become this man.
Who misses her lips and kisses his hands
That yearning might into her touch redeem.
In love, to longing my heart has been damned.
Forever I will give the best I can.
Forever I want to drink from her stream.
I never thought I would become this man.

Whispered words are fruits picked up by you and me.
Open your eyes in this new mystery to see

Drifting On The Sea Of Destiny Villanelle 

With great pain my heart does rage on this night,
while it feels as if in my life there will never again be a happy day,
as if all hope and new tomorrows are slowly fading with the light
and done a thousand times are all the things that I might do right,
crushed like the shelling of eons and on the beach while children laugh and play.
With great pain my heart does rage on this night,
full of new horizons at a time the future was something bright
with hopes and dreams in a sea of faith on a tranquil milk-white bay;
as if all hope and new tomorrows are slowly fading with the light,
I see a swarm of doves in an alarmed fluttering turning flight
while like a paper caravel my life sails sluggishly away.
With great pain my heart does rage on this night,
while in the angry sea in the banks of fog nothing is in sight
just the rushing tidal wave and its oncoming spray,
as if all hope and new tomorrows are slowly fading with the light
while down God might be looking from his great height
and constantly countless prayers I do pray.
With great pain my heart does rage on this night,
as if all hope and new tomorrows are slowly fading with the light.

Eviction Of A Farmer Villanelle 

The farm has been empty all summer long
Once a happy homestead thriving with life
Barns now empty where did it all go wrong
Only the mice play and dance with a song
Emptiness can be cut through with a knife
The farm has been empty all summer long
Deserted yards where cows did once throng
Waiting to be milked by the farmerâ€™s dear wife
Barns now empty where did it all go wrong
Fields where cows grazed that once did belong
Now where only the weeds and thistles are rife
The farm has been empty all summer long
Squeezed by the supermarkets who prolong
The inevitable who caused all their strife
Barns now empty where did it all go wrong
A life now in ruins is their final swansong
A farm once thriving surrendered to wildlife
The farm has been empty all summer long
Barns now empty where did it all go wrong

Far Too Long Villanelle 

Although I had been hurt severely by love,
far too long I had been searching for you.
Far too long through this world I did rove,
but never did I want to remove
even a single moment even if we did argue.
Although I had been hurt severely by love,
now our love, our commitment does prove
its own value even if painful things you do.
Far too long through this world I did rove,
even if I sometimes do disapprove
still together we do continue.
although I had been hurt severely by love,
you do remain the one, who fits my life like a glove,
with whom happiness I want to pursue.
Far too long through this world I did rove,
before together we did move
and when I met you all of my wildest dreams came true,
although I had been hurt severely by love;
far too long through this world I did roveâ€¦

For Mel Villanelle 

The one who should have lived has gone so fast.
The old ones, in their dotage, linger on â€“
they, with no future, live only in the past.
And we who can but sit, dumb and aghast,
scarcely believe that while the sun still shone
the one who should have lived has gone so fast.
Six decades older, surviving to their last
few days or years, together but alone,
they, with no future, live only in the past.
At least she kept on living to the last,
but should have had a future. She has none.
The one who should have lived has gone so fast,
and they, for whom so many years have passed,
are unaware that one they loved is gone.
They, with no future, live only in the past,
mark time until the final trumpet blast,
and never know the respite they have won.
The one who should have lived has gone so fast.
They, with no future, live only in the past.

Ginger Cat Villanelle 

I am a spoiled, lazy ginger cat
I am lying on the sofa all day long
And yes, i am a cat that is  very fat
I am posh and proud to be your pet
I n your eyes i never do wrong
I am a spoiled, lazy ginger cat
I will not chase that dirty rat
I am OK, on the sofa is were i belong
And yes, i am a cat that is very fat
You can bash the rat with a bat
Cook him in a pot, feed him to Mr Chong
I am a spoiled, lazy ginger cat
Other cats see me and they frat
I am a top cat, i lead with a midnight song
And yes i am a cat that is very fat
I am that fat cat who sat on the mat
all morning, until you heard the gong
I am a spoiled, lazy ginger cat
And yes, i am a cat that is very fat

Gloria Lifes Glorious A Villanelle 

Her nights burn with passion, sweet candies and kisses,
Like a phantom she appeared, passing by the window
Wouldn't someone save her before life passes by and hisses?
She vanishes into the crowd, among the misters and misses,
Helplessly she tries to escape from the sinister flow
Her nights burn with passion, sweet candies and kisses.
In vain she pleads for freedom from the demon her foolishness pisses.
Painfully she cried as he scratches her open wound and woe
Wouldn't someone save her, before life passes by and hisses?
Abandoned, she sits in the dark, her days she reminisces;
Her sin tattooed across her name like red blood upon white snow,
Her nights burn with passion, sweet candies and kisses.
Lost in the fever, broken hopes and shattered wishes.
Softly her lips tremble, her life is but a show
Wouldn't someone save her before life passes by and hisses?
Madness poisons her laughter as her emotion sharply dismisses,
"Oh Gloria, life's glorious! Isn't it so? "
Her nights burn with passion, sweet candies and kisses,
Wouldn't someone save her before life passes by and hisses?

He Stole His Eyes From A Milk Glass Moon Villanelle 

He stole his eyes from a milk-glass moon,
From drops of peridot scattered at sea,
Hidden beneath a moon-shadowed ruin.
His father not caring where or with whom,
Or from what rare ocean his being might be-
He stole his eyes from a milk-glass moon.
He learnt his letters from a dark winged loon
Who flew where the mountains caress the trees,
Hidden beneath a moon-shadowed ruin.
His speech was a garble of false and truth,
Whistling like a hollow piped reed,
He stole his eyes from a milk-glass moon.
His eyes a contagion of waters blue
And brackish trunks of underwater trees
Hidden beneath a moon-shadowed ruin.
His normal voice wove a threadless tune,
Brought close the mermaids, hungry to feed;
He stole his eyes from a milk-glass moon,
Hidden beneath a moon-shadowed ruin.

I Cannot Help To More And More Love You Villanelle 

I cannot help to more and more love you
and wish to be giving you bunches of roses
while I miss you with everything that I do
but unexpected a deadly virus came out of the blue
and with it the government severe restrictions imposes.
I cannot help to more and more love you
while locked-down of your thoughts I do not have a clue,
but know that extreme danger to everyone it poses,
while I miss you with everything that I do
and I do not know were everything is leading to,
only that borders and travelling the government closes.
I cannot help to more and more love you
where I know you through and through
and far too many people it indisposes
while I miss you with everything that I do.
where it looks similar to normal flue,
while poems many heart-felt feelings encloses,
I cannot help to more and more love you,
while I miss you with everything that I do.

I Miss You And The Missing Does Severally Remain Villanelle 

It's another chilly day with unseasoned winter rain,
with frost damaging my flowers almost everywhere,
where everything in life seems to be totally in vain.
The government do measures against the virus explain
and this kind of thing no one did expect or for prepare,
It's another chilly day with unseasoned winter rain
and throughout the world there is sorrow and pain,
while of you and your love I am constantly aware,
where everything in life seems to be totally in vain,
while people do about police brutality complain
and I picture you combing through your fair hair.
It's another chilly day with unseasoned winter rain,
that a deadly thing comes from China is very plain.
I do to the depth of my heart and soul for you care,
where everything in life seems to be totally in vain
but I miss you and the missing does severally remain
and I picture you dressing with your usual lovely flair.
It's another chilly day with unseasoned winter rain,
where everything in life seems to be totally in vain.

In A Madmans Rush The Worm Gets Born Villanelle 

In a madman's rush, the worm gets born:
As shouting words do the fight unleash,
Moon's in eyes, and the soul gets shorn.
Why lay hands on the things that harm,
When there's brokenwinged wonder, in our speech-
In a madman's rush, the worm gets born.
The shroud is lost, unravelled and torn,
And human mercy is but a leech:
Moon's in eyes, and the soul gets shorn.
Scorpion's sting, and mankind's scorn;
It seems real justice is out of reach:
In a madman's rush, the worm gets born.
The unicorn has lost his horn;
The mermaid's dead upon the beach-
Moon's in eyes, and the soul gets shorn.
My thoughts are deep and as forlorn;
For man, by the heart of him's impeached:
In a madman's rush, the worm gets born,
Moon's in eyes, and the soul gets shorn.

Though we do not know each other many years
in each other our love has find a home

that separately we no longer must roam.
though we do not know each other many years

With songs of jubilance in our ears

In Your Pretty Eyes Villanelle 

Their beauty is a wonderful surprise,
But even after the blushed sunset fades,
I will find Heaven in your pretty eyes.
Holding hands, we walk as one beneath skies
Where the smoldering sun wears clouds as shades;
Their beauty is a wonderful surprise,
And although the sea is mighty, it shies,
Like a pup at play - pounces and evades.
I will find Heaven in your pretty eyes.
On the black sands, head rested on your thighs,
I lovingly play with your virgin braids,
Their beauty is a wonderful surprise.
Looking up, I see you - my greatest prize.
O! I love your body's perfect cascades.
I will find Heaven in your pretty eyes.
Together we will walk with the fireflies,
-Sacred lovers attempting their crusades-
Their beauty is a wonderful surprise.
I will find Heaven in your pretty eyes.

I Saw Young Men Boys Just Out Of School Villanelle 

I saw young men, boys just out of school,
working men with university degrees
far too clever to be any anyoneâ€™s fool
being called up for war, being tossed into its whirlpool
set on fire and burning like a bunch of trees.
I saw young men, boys just out of school,
who over war did not drool
but hated every moment of it, men with great qualities
far too clever to be anyoneâ€™s fool
whoâ€™s lives were threaded out like from a spool,
treated like mere sediment, dregs, refuse, like lees.
I saw young men, boys just out of school,
in places flaming hot, icy cold wearing jerseys of wool,
praying, standing in the wilderness on their knees
far too clever to be any anyoneâ€™s fool
with pierced bodies draining in bloody pool after bloody pool
becoming the sons of Cain, the devils own employees
and I saw young men, boys just out of school,

burning, aflame before the end of day
bravely carrying on before the dying of light
raging in war busy with a almost endless fight
with no chance to ever again dance and play.
I saw young men keeping courage in the grim night
trying their utmost to do whatâ€™s right
challenging a outnumbering foe they
bravely carrying on before the dying of light
looking at enemy warplanes in their flight,
seeing bombs dropping down on their way.
I saw young men keeping courage in the grim night
seeing with blinded eyes far past sight
another world, a glassy sea and its bay
bravely carrying on before the dying of light
looking at a heaven endlessly bright,
cursed but before finality, on their knees to pray
and I saw young men keeping courage in the grim night
bravely carrying on before the dying of light.

Let Our Love Be As It Ought Villanelle 

Let our love be as it ought
while you are true to me,
with something special in every thought
as something valuable that we have brought
that goes much further than just charity.
Let our love be as it ought
simple, sincere as if its joy cannot be bought
as it is present with us daily
with something special in every thought
that comes by itself out of the blue unsought
as a gift from the divine without iniquity.
Let our love be as it ought
like a pool of cool water in the drought,
that more than quenches and sets the spirit free

in the way that by God it is set to be.

Life has changed from what it was before,

Life has changed from what it was before,
while still you are in my centre core,
in my thoughts, in my blood and my heart.
I do not known what the future has in store,
deaths and illness are present more and more
and in communist China all of this did start.
Life has changed from what it was before
and I pray that God do all of humanity restore
that he does the devil's deadly evil plans thwart.
I do not known what the future has in store,
and still daily more and more I do you adore
where to me you are both beautiful and smart.

Love Is Not Something That Is For Sale Villanelle 

Love is not something that is for sale,
it does burn with its own kind of flame,
it does not become trite or even stale,
it does exist between male and female
and between people it is not the same.
Love is not something that is for sale,
about its affects there are many a tale
and for it people do have many a name,
it does not become trite or even stale,
it brings people back when all other things fail
but for some people it's just a kind of game.
Love is not something that is for sale
and at the loss of it some people do turn pale,
others think it's something that you can tame,
it does not become trite or even stale
and for its intensity there is no kind of scale
it can bring a person joy, happiness or shame.
Love is not something that is for sale,
it does not become trite or even stale.

Lovers Villanelle 

Time after time, two lovers return
To meet face-to-face and eye-to-eye.
With just one touch, their passions burn.
Each time they meet, a lesson to learn,
Past lives to relive, and once again die.
Time after time, two lovers return
To the wrong place and time, again to yearn.
Adulterous lovers are bound to cry.
With just one touch, their passions burn.
A ring on his finger, their one concern.
They deny each other and say goodbye.
Time after time, two lovers return
To the right place and time.  True love is earned.
They meet face-to-face, he smiles, she sighs.
With just one touch, their passions burn.
Love at first sight, a lesson learned.
Be true to your heart and don't ask why.
Time after time, two lovers return.
With just one touch, their passions burn.

The frothy waves like millwheels turn-
Blow wind, blow him back to me.
He promised he would stay with me,

My lover's gone to sail the sea.
What other lover could there be?
Than one who makes my tired heart yearn;
Blow wind, blow him back to me.
He swore he'd never set me free
And my embrace, would never spurn;
My lover's gone to sail the sea.
He vowed his love on bended knee;
My thoughts like blackest waves do churn-
Blow wind, blow him back to me.
With those wild winds, I won't agree;

Blow wind, blow him back to me.

Ode To Spring Villanelle 

Soft shoots spring gently forth from the earth
They look to the sky with their open face
After the cold winter comes springs rebirth
New buds on trees grow for all their worth
Each day they welcome the suns warm embrace
Soft shoots spring gently forth from the earth
The sparrows and robins have all given birth
And nature wakes up at a slow walking pace
After the cold winter comes springs rebirth
The daffodils now open their face full of mirth
And crocuses blossoms all over the place
Soft shoots spring gently forth from the earth
Natures bright canvas spreads forth its girth
Apple blossoms fragrant blooms now race
After the cold winter comes springs rebirth
The warmth of the sun providing safe berth
For all creatures of the wood or open space
Soft shoots spring gently forth from the earth
After the cold winter comes springs rebirth

there are marks on the windowsill,
suddenly a thunderstorm came,

and from China a deadly thing does kill
while the UN holds nobody to blame.
A dark cloak does the evening fill,
Scientists on television brag about their skill,

By needlework, a soft relief is built.

No architectural coup or princely gilt.

Between opposed currents, it's easy to slip.

A seagull forewarns with a wind-tossed screech.
I pay no heed and swim into a rip.
Effervescence spills as blue waves unzip.
Broken shells in tide swept scallops gleam peach.
Between opposed currents, it's easy to slip.
In lime-weeded rock pools, olive crabs nip.
On Isaac's Rock unwieldy rollers breach.

Toe-anchoring bottom drops out of reach.

And Winter shall release its icy reign

Alas, despite their mighty mien

The Lights In My Head Villanelle 

There's a light in the sickroom that never goes dead,
Though daylight is dimming, through the still open curtain-
But the light's in my head; the light's in my head!
He lies in a stupor, but calls out from his bed;
And he never complains, but you fear that he's hurting-
There's a light in the sickroom that never goes dead.
She doesn't sleep nights, but sleeps daytimes instead;
Her breathing's still even, but death's near for certain-
But the light's in my head; the light's in my head!
First they said stroke, and then heart attack- dread!
With the new diagnosis, with death he is flirting-
There's a light in the sickroom that never goes dead.
There's cancer and heart disease, so lightly we tread;
It's bad news for sure- her aneurysm bursting! -
But the light's in my head; the light's in my head!
It's all here inside me now, all that I've said,
Now what's left in memory's darkness, I'm cursing;
There's a light in the sickroom that never goes dead-
And the light's in my head- the light's in my head!

The world is divided; attacks are incoming
With trucks, guns, knives and bombs; and the street runs red
And we are still here watching acts unbecoming

The scriptures verify everything He has said
And we are still here watching acts unbecoming
The Savior's foot on Mount Zion is forthcoming
Our sins are remitted from the time that He bled
The Lord Jesus has delayed His second coming

The Meaning Of Our Love Villanelle 

Maybe we couldn't understand the meaning of our love or so,
Maybe we couldn't find each other in our world of two and

Love made sense for both of us, but we didn't let it flow,
Though we could let it flow, but we didn't give it a chance, and
Maybe we couldn't understand the meaning of our love or so.
Maybe the senses of our love were intermingled and we didn't know,
But we knew it, when we touched our angry bodies, we knew that
Love itself ceased to be, 'cause it had no sense  to glow.
Then, we letted our love madness be a big bubble growin' to blow,
That kind of madness making us be drinkers of our own delusions, and
Maybe we couldn't understand the meaning of our love or so.
We understood the dyin'  meaning of those delusions in our live show.
They have been dissolved into sorrow until our separation, and
Love itself ceased to be, 'cause it had no sense to glow.
Now, when we drive with time machine on the old age o' the snow,
â€˜Tis too late to search each other in our world of two, and

I thus go, and the road grows with my feet.
When in all but your eyes sunlight is a sin,
And its gleaming guilt pricks the defiant eyes,
In darkness we trip, and roads may mislead.
I might as well caution against a futile risk-
Like quenching thirst in every drop of rain,
But I go, and the road grows with my feet.
While a fawning disgrace fieriest words read,
and with outpouring turmoil, reason becomes vain
In desperation we trip, and roads may mislead.
But trailblazers fear not the stone-carved creed,
and march on in every inch of treacherous terrain
I thus go far, and the road grows with my feet.
I feel the breeze when time transcends history.
Its power winds through, if only short in glory.
In darkness we trip, and roads may mislead,
I thus go far, and the road grows with my feet.

The Sacred Tree Villanelle 

Bright feelings of love fall from the sacred tree,
Memories are time limbs coming from the past,
Whispered words are fruits picked up by you and me.
Kisses feed my hunger for your bel esprit
And rock us to heights in this basic contrast.
Bright feelings of love fall from the sacred tree.
Come dance with me in the thoughts' ring to be free.
The rays of dream shine through the room's pain to last.
Whispered words are fruits picked up by you and me.
Open your eyes to this mystery to see
These seconds, coming into a sense, so fast.
Bright feelings of love fall from the sacred tree.
Feelings are flowers to make a potpourri.
We are small in this immensity so vast.
Whispered words are fruits picked up by you and me.
Someday, you will bounce your baby on your knee.
In the broken horizon, dreams will be passed.
Bright feelings of love fall from the sacred tree.
Whispered words are fruits picked up by you and me.

The Shepherdess Villanelle 

A shepherdess with a lamb to her breast
Against a dry stone wall on a windy hill
She cradles it with love so truly blessed
Over steep Welsh hills they roam best
Hardy hill sheep bred to wander at will
A shepherdess with a lamb to her breast
Long fleeces waving in springs unrest
Bleating lambs at teats taking their fill
She cradles it with love so truly blessed
A brooding landscape the ultimate test
The valley below a patchwork sits still
A shepherdess with a lamb to her breast
Her love is her flock she tenders with zest
Caring for her lambs with love and skill
She cradles it with love so truly blessed
A shepherdess her lambs so caressed
Her life with her sheep is always a thrill
A shepherdess with a lamb to her breast
She cradles it with love so truly blessed

They Each Write About It As It Sees Them Fit Villanelle 

They each write about it as it sees them fit:
Poets and writers, pouring out words;
Keeping to parity their own souls wit.
Snatching words from thin air, as they sit,
For they each have their own distinct worlds;
They each write about it as it sees them fit.
Giving to the page their own token bit,
As the truth deep inside them slowly unfurls;
Keeping to parity their own souls wit.
Writing's something they never can quit,
Scribbling's something they to all else prefer:
They each write about it, as it sees them fit.
Life to them is never just a skit,
They would never want to go unheard;
Keeping to their own souls wit.
From piece to piece, their busy mind flits,
And their heart singing just like a bird;
They each write about it as it sees them fit,
Keeping to parity their own souls wit.

To My Lost One Villanelle 

If you come from a unknown place
from where I am, as if thrown
into my life and we again meet face-to-face
it may be by Godâ€™s grace
and we may leave the paths well trodden and known.
If you come from a unknown place
wherever it may be, carrying just one suitcase
I will be happy to meet you, if you come alone
into my life and we again meet face-to-face
and if you want to, we can disappear without a trace
be on our own, without anyone.
If you come from a unknown place
and walk into my embrace,
my lost one, come without a chaperone
into my life and we again meet face-to-face
our pasts will be erased
and all unhappiness will be gone,
if you come from a unknown place
into my life and we again meet face-to-face.

Van Der Deckeniii Villanelle 

Just before a huge gale in the dim twilight
people do notice your ancient ship sailing past in the last part of day
while the breakers do rage in that coming night
where as an apparition some people are of you in great fright,
and do mind their children off the beach where they do play.
Just before a huge gale in the dim twilight
you do look in dismay at the evening star shining bright,
in vain time and again try to reach the milk-white bay
while the breakers do rage in that coming night,
in great anger see albatrosses in their landward flight
but from that harbour constantly you are kept away.
Just before a huge gale in the dim twilight
you are so near that the southern shore is in sight
but the yardage creak, the blocks rattle with the coming spray,
while the breakers do rage in that coming night
where in anger you again lift your fist at the mast's top height
sometimes do curse God or for mercy do beg and pray
just before a huge gale in the dim twilight
while the breakers do rage in that coming night.

Villanelle A Silver City Of Ones Dreams 

A glorious city spired gleams up there
With mountain ranges, silver peaks background
The wayfarer much wonder-struck does stare
A dream appears to have come true but rare
A road that winds through thick forest is found
A glorious city spired gleams up there
The road is lined by silver birches fair
And deer so freely grazing here are found
The wayfarer much wonder-struck does stare
The smell of musk and berries fills the air
In trance, the traveler walks the road dumbfound
A glorious city spired gleams up there
The rain-cast skies have clouds like silverware
The heavenly scene is haunting holy ground
The wayfarer much wonder-struck does stare
To reach the dream-like city, all would dare
No wonder all whoâ€™ve seen the place are bound
A glorious city spired gleams up there
The wayfarer much wonder-struck does stare

Villanelle At Sundown 

Turn your head. Look. The light is turning yellow.
The river seems enriched thereby, not to say deepened.
Why this is, I'll never be able to tell you.
Or are Americans half in love with failure?
One used to say so, reading Fitzgerald, as it happened.
(That Viking Portable, all water spotted and yellow--
remember?) Or does mere distance lend a value
to things? --false, it may be, but the view is hardly cheapened.
Why this is, I'll never be able to tell you.
The smoke, those tiny cars, the whole urban millieu--
One can like anything diminishment has sharpened.
Our painter friend, Lang, might show the whole thing yellow
and not be much off. It's nuance that counts, not color--
As in some late James novel, saved up for the long weekend
and vivid with all the Master simply won't tell you.
How frail our generation has got, how sallow
and pinched with just surviving! We all go off the deep end
finally, gold beaten thinly out to yellow.
And why this is, I'll never be able to tell you.

Villanelle Of Acheron 

By the pale marge of Acheron,
Me thinks we shall pass restfully,
Beyond the scope of any sun.
There all men hie them one by one,
Far from the stress of earth and sea,
By the pale marge of Acheron.
'Tis well when life and love is done,
'Tis very well at last to be,
Beyond the scope of any sun.
No busy voices there shall stun
Our ears: the stream flows silently
By the pale marge of Acheron.
There is the crown of labour won,
The sleep of immortality,
Beyond the scope of any sun.
Life, of thy gifts I will have none,
My queen is that Persephone,
By the pale marge of Acheron,
Beyond the scope of any sun.

Villanelle Of Change 

Since Persia fell at Marathon,
The yellow years have gathered fast:
Long centuries have come and gone.
And yet (they say) the place will don
A phantom fury of the past,
Since Persia fell at Marathon;
And as of old, when Helicon
Trembled and swayed with rapture vast
(Long centuries have come and gone),
This ancient plain, when night comes on,
Shakes to a ghostly battle-blast,
Since Persia fell at Marathon.
But into soundless Acheron
The glory of Greek shame was cast:
Long centuries have come and gone,
The suns of Hellas have all shone,
The first has fallen to the last: --
Since Persia fell at Marathon,
Long centuries have come and gone.

Villanelle Of Marguerites 

'A little, _passionately, not at all?_'
She casts the snowy petals on the air:
And what care we how many petals fall!
Nay, wherefore seek the seasons to forestall?
It is but playing, and she will not care,
A little, passionately, not at all!
She would not answer us if we should call
Across the years: her visions are too fair;
And what care we how many petals fall!
She knows us not, nor recks if she enthrall
With voice and eyes and fashion of her hair,
A little, passionately, not at all!
Knee-deep she goes in meadow grasses tall,
Kissed by the daisies that her fingers tear:
And what care we how many petals fall!
We pass and go: but she shall not recall
What men we were, nor all she made us bear:
'_A little, passionately, not at all!_'
And what care we how many petals fall!

Villanelle Of Spring Bells 

Bells in the town alight with spring
converse, with a concordance of new airs
make clear the fresh and ancient sound they sing.
People emerge from winter to hear them ring,
children glitter with mischief and the blind man hears
bells in the town alight with spring.
Even he on his eyes feels the caressing
finger of Persephone, and her voice escaped from tears
make clear the fresh and ancient sound they sing.
Bird feels the enchantment of his wing
and in ten fine notes dispels twenty cares.
Bells in the town alight with spring
warble the praise of Time, for he can bring
this season: chimes the merry heaven bears
make clear the fresh and ancient sound they sing.
All evil men intent on evil thing
falter, for in their cold unready ears
bells in the town alight with spring
make clear the fresh and ancient sound they sing.

Villanelle Of The Poets Road 

Wine and woman and song,
Three things garnish our way:
Yet is day over long.
Lest we do our youth wrong,
Gather them while we may:
Wine and woman and song.
Three things render us strong,
Vine leaves, kisses and bay:
Yet is day over long.
Unto us they belong,
Us the bitter and gay,
Wine and women and song.
We, as we pass along,
Are sad that they will not stay;
Yet is day over long.
Fruits and flowers among,
What is better than they:
Wine and women and song?
Yet is day over long.

Villanelle Of The Temptress 

Are you not weary of ardent ways,
Lure of the fallen seraphim?
Tell no more of enchanted days.
Your eyes have set man's heart ablaze
And you have had your will of him.
Are you not weary of ardent ways?
Above the flame the smoke of praise
Goes up from ocean rim to rim.
Tell no more of enchanted days.
Our broken cries and mournful lays
Rise in one eucharistic hymn.
Are you not weary of ardent ways?
While sacrificing hands upraise
The chalice flowing to the brim,
Tell no more of enchanted days.
And still you hold our longing gaze
With languorous look and lavish limb!
Are you not weary of ardent ways?
Tell no more of enchanted days.

Villanelle Of Ye Young Poets First Villanelle To His Ladye And Ye Difficulties Thereof 

To sing the charms of Rosabelle,
To pour my soul out at her feet,
I try to write this villanelle.
Now I am caught within her spell,
It seems to me most wondrous sweet
To sing the charms of Rosabelle.
I seek in vain for words to tell
My love -- Alas, my muse is weak!
I try to write this villanelle.
Would I had power to compel
The English language incomplete
To sing the charms of Rosabelle.
The ardent thoughts that in me dwell
On paper I would fair repeat
I try to write this villanelle.
My effort fruitless is. O H--l!
I'll tell her all when next we meet.
To sing the charms of Rosabelle,

Villanelle On Depression 

Depression is a fact of life for me.
As much a part of life as food and air,
It hovers like a dreaded entity.
It scatters joys like useless stale debris,
And sews the ashes of my dreams in gloom.
Depression is a fact of life for me.
It poises like a shadowing banshee
With somber wings just waiting to enshroud.
It hovers like a dreaded entity,
And I can almost always guarantee
Secreted in my spectral holidays
Depression is a fact of life for me.
My life becomes a frequent abductee
Purloined by mirthless bird of prey
It hovers like a dreaded entity..
A vulture pouncing when my back is turned,
But hidden, and not easily discerned.
Depression is a fact of life for me
It hovers like a dreaded entity.

Apollo left the golden Muse
And shepherded a mortal's sheep,
Theocritus of Syracuse!
To mock the giant swain that woo's
The sea-nymph in the sunny deep,
Apollo left the golden Muse.
Afield he drove his lambs and ewes,
Where Milon and where Battus reap,
Theocritus of Syracuse!
To watch thy tunny-fishers cruise
Below the dim Sicilian steep
Apollo left the golden Muse.
Ye twain did loiter in the dews,
Ye slept the swain's unfever'd sleep,
Theocritus of Syracuse!
That Time might half with HIS confuse
Thy songs,--like his, that laugh and leap, -
Theocritus of Syracuse,
Apollo left the golden Muse!

And so do I, I fear.
I have lost my turtle dove.
If you love will never move
My faith also is clear
I must go and find my love.
Your grief will always move,
And I too grieve, my dear
I have lost my turtle-dove.
I see no more my treasure trove
Nothing fairer is there here

Death, for which I call above,

It is the pain, it is the pain endures.
Your chemic beauty burned my muscles through.
Poise of my hands reminded me of yours.
What later purge from this deep toxin cures?
What kindness now could the old salve renew?
It is the pain, it is the pain endures.
The infection slept (custom or changes inures)
And when pain's secondary phase was due
Poise of my hands reminded me of yours.
How safe I felt, whom memory assures,
Rich that your grace safely by heart I knew.
It is the pain, it is the pain endures.
My stare drank deep beauty that still allures.
My heart pumps yet the poison draught of you.
Poise of my hands reminded me of yours.
You are still kind whom the same shape immures.
Kind and beyond adieu. We miss our cue.
It is the pain, it is the pain endures.
Poise of my hands reminded me of yours.

A dainty thing's the Villanelle.
Sly, musical, a jewel in rhyme,
It serves its purpose passing well.
A doublc-clappered silver bell
That must be made to clink in chime,
A dainty thing's the Villanelle;
And if you wish to flute a spell,
Or ask a meeting 'neath the lime,
It serves its purpose passing well.
You must not ask of it the swell
Of organs grandiose and sublime-
A dainty thing's the Villanelle;
And, filled with sweetness, as a shell
Is filled with sound, and launched in time,
It serves its purpose passing well.
Still fair to see and good to smell
As in the quaintness of its prime,
A dainty thing's the Villanelle,
It serves its purpose passing well.

Women, children and men-Why swallowed Thee?
Perhaps, you acted with insanity!
The havoc caused to mankind is painful;
The home of fishes most, O hallowed Sea!
Perhaps, it was just one calamity!
The land seems bruised, so gloomy and awful;
Women, children and men-Why swallowed Thee?
The missing ones are umptine- what pity!
The persons saved looked rather sorrowful;

Man paid his price for being not careful;

We Had To Fight A War For What Is Right Villanelle 

We had to fight in a war for what is right,
as children we were called to be brave men,
did bring deliverance in that dark night,
at a time when our fancies could take flight,
had to act like great heroes against each omen.
We had to fight in a war for what is right,
were forced to learn discipline and might;
for two years we were gone from all women,
did bring deliverance in that dark night,
we bended to orders when the sun was bright,
was humiliated, trained, used when
we had to fight in a war for what is right,
as we acted selfless in our great fright
to survive, like machines, were trained then
did bring deliverance in that dark night,
while politicians talked from their height
for a whole country boys carried the burden;
we had to fight in a war for what is right,
did bring deliverance in that dark night.

Flowers and poems to you I have sent,
At times gifts to you I did present
and at times your tears I have dried,

but most of all I prayed for the virus to end
while from it many people have died.
Flowers and poems to you I have sent,

Where The Wildflowers Bloom Villanelle 

In the warmth of the sun wildflowers bloom
Along the side of the road and on the Gower
Where Cornflower Poppy and Daisies lift the gloom
Summers blaze of colour explodes with a boom
With such an overwhelming sense of power
In the warmth of the sun wildflowers bloom
They blow in the breeze with their sweet perfume
The Autumn Hawkbit foxglove and Cuckooflower
Where Cornflower Poppy and Daisies lift the gloom
A wildflower meadow charm will utterly consume
And the thoughts of their beauty will empower
In the warmth of the sun wildflowers bloom
Bewitched by the beauty of their petal costume
Or the colour of Foxgloves delightful bellflower
Where Cornflower Poppy and Daisies lift the gloom
Wildflowers are the glory of nature we can assume
In their company your senses they will overpower
In the warmth of the sun wildflowers bloom
Where Cornflower Poppy and Daisies lift the gloom

Wish Wish The Darkness All Away Villanelle 

So comes the end of another day,
Dig the grave and let it be:

Though there were things you wished to say,
Man is man, and men are free:
So comes the end of another day.
Unsaid the words, and left them lay;
Man is spineless, small and weak:
Wish, wish the darkness all away.
If once the world was good and gay,
The bold will rise and crush the meek:
So comes the end of another day.
The heart more bitter, to repay
The giver of the wound it seeks:
Wish, wish the darkness all away.
And so we take the longest way;
Just plug the heart, or let it leak,
So comes the end of another day:
Wish, wish the darkness all away.

while the sheen of the sun has something almost divine

You and the grandchildren do my life complete

It's as if it's you and our grandchildren I want to greet
but my glance does only an empty garden outside meet.
I do go back to posting some poetry
