Pass around the cup fair maiden

Pass around the cup fair maiden, 
Because Love seemed easy at first, 
But now I see how difficult it is. 
The hearts of Lovers bleed, 
and will be doomed to break, 
when the scent of the Beloved blows away in the wind. 
How can the traveller stay safe 
when the clarion calls its sound of parting? 
The Master tells us: 
"soak your prayer rug red with wine, my friend". 
Those who are still on the shore 
feel they have peace of mind, 
they don't know our storms and dark nights. 
But at last, I find the Secret, 
hidden in street corners, 
revealed before me. 
Hafiz, enjoy her Love 
And instruct her, 
"suffer the darkness for the sake of the light".

If the Shirazi Turk would only grant my heart's desire

If the Shirazi Turk would only grant my heart's desire, 
I'd give up Samarkand and Bukhara for the poorest part of her. 
Fair maiden, serve all of the old Wine now, 
if you wait for paradise 
you won't find drinking partners such as these! 
The heavenly musicians play well, 
Like plundering Turks, 
they have plundered all my patience. 
For my poor love has been rejected by my Beloved, 
Before my Beloved's beauty, 
my talk of "love" is like an insult. 
My Beloved is as beautiful as Joseph, 
My Beloved's Love strong enough to enchant Zulaikha. 
I long for you, even as your words of rejection 
still sound in the air; 
Anything sounds sweet, if your lips say it. 
Enjoy Wine and Music in every moment, 
O fortunate young people, heed the advice of Hafiz!

Zephyr, reach my charming gazelle and say

Zephyr, reach my charming gazelle and say: 
because of you I've wandered through hill and desert, 
look kindly on my excitement and awe, 
favour me with your sweet divine lips! 
You're so proud of your roselike charm, 
that you will never think to ask of your nightingale. 
Wise birds cannot be caught by tricks or cunning, 
only by gentle good-tempered Love. 
Anyone who harps on their beauty and charm 
Hides a lack of loyalty, friendship, true devotion.
When you enjoy drinks with your caring friends, 
Remember my love, consider my true feeling. 
There's no loyalty found in mere appearances. 
But Hafiz, your sweet sincere songs 
can move the Angels themselves.

My heart is going wild

My heart is going wild! 
Help me, o masters! 
My secret love becomes revealed for all time! 
We are broken boats, 
you will not help us wind, move on, 
perhaps you'll be more useful to a friend. 
The love of this world lasts only a few days. 
It is all fantasy and sentiment. 
Be good to your friends, 
while you still have the chance. 
"how badly I want the morning's drink", 
said the nightingale last evening, 
while surrounded by sweet flowers. 
Be grateful for the blessings you have, 
fortunate man! 
Help the poor mystic as much as you're able. 
There is happiness in heaven and earth, 
if only two creeds are followed: 
"Be just to your friend, 
make peace with your foe". 
And if you have never reached the houses of fame and fortune, 
Admit that you cannot change what is written. 
When you feel miserable and self-pitying, 
Drink wine, and take pleasure, 
in this way the pauper can find the richest secret.
The cup of wine is like the mirror of Alexander, 
through it he took the kingdom of Darius. 
Forgive me o well-dressed Priest, 
It is the will of Allah, if my cloth is smeared with wine.

Come, fair maiden

Come, fair maiden! 
And bring us pure Wine 
to help us forget the sufferings of time. 
Help us throw off the cloak of falseness and its ways, 
I don't care to be respected, 
though it does no harm to those who are truly wise.
The flame of my burning heart 
has burnt away all poorer hearts 
with its bright rays of good. 
My love-crazy heart cries out, saying: 
"Who can I tell the divine secret to?" 
I enjoy the divine company of my Beloved, 
Even though my Beloved 
has taken away all my peace of mind. 
The cypress, the flowers, and all work of art, 
They mean nothing to me, 
now that my Beloved has given me this gift. 
O Hafiz, suffer the challenge, and be wise. 
You are destined to find your home.

Good news, lovely nightingale

Good news, lovely nightingale! 
The garden is filled with life again! 
Warm wind, when you fly along the pastures, 
send word to the delicate flowers: 
"I will stay forever at the door of the tavern, 
because the serving-girl is too beautiful to miss, 
Beloved! I have lost myself in lovesickness for you, 
In your heart I sail as safely as in Noah's Ark" 
Those who condemn the drinkers 
will lose all their piousness and beliefs

Brother believers

Brother believers, 
whatever shall we do? 
The priest left the mosque 
for the tavern yesterday! 
How can the believers 
turn to Mecca to pray? 
When our Mullah 
turns to the tavern instead?! 
The joy of the Beloved is insane, 
we are madmen 
trapped in the curls of her hair. 
It was written 
that we would find this life 
All is written, 
and our lives prove this. 
The face of the beloved is grace, 
When I see it, 
I can see nothing but beauty around me. 
Does the fire of my sighs 
And the flame of the beloved's shadow in me 
Affect your stony hearts? 
I had wondered if it might!

time and space! 
How can anything stand against such power?

Fair maiden, make bright our cups with wine

O you who are ignorant of the bliss of wine:

because in the cup I see the Friend's reflection. 
In the Book of Life, my name is eternal. 
No one dies who's heart is on fire with Love. 
warm wind, if you ever fly past the Friend say: 
"Why should I try to forget my name? 
There will come a time when you, too, will forget it!" 
It is good to find peace in the eyes of the Friend,
for that reason I drink wine. 
The "clean foods" of the Priest,

I think they'll earn the same.

The beauty of your face, my Beloved

The beauty of your face, my Beloved, 
strikes my heart like a piercing arrow. 
Before creation existed, there was Love. 
Love is the greatest work of the Divine. 
Narcissus found love only by happenstance, 
and Helen's eyes caused wars by a mere gaze. 
But when I wandered last night 
through the garden, 
The budding flowers reminded me of your lips. 
The wind-blown violets, fresh and joyous 
brought my memory back to the beauty of your curls.
Now I wash my cloak in clear wine, 
no man can escape what is Written. 
Hafiz: endure love, and you'll succeed, 
if you admit that this is what is Written. 
The whole world now turns to the desire of my heart, 
because I have become sincere 
in my devotion to the Beloved.

The Friend's Love sets my heart afire

The Friend's Love sets my heart afire, 
and this fire burns my entire being. 
My body wasted away from the separation from the Friend, 
My soul wastes away! 
What is the purpose of Love? 
Even the candles feel sorry for my suffering, 
I burn more than they do. 
All my beliefs are tested by the wine of the tavern, 
All of my notions are washed away by it! 
When I tried to put aside the cup, 
it was cause for regret, 
My heart aches without wine! 
Come close, Friend, and speak Truth,

the candle has burnt through the night,

All who have entered this world will leave it. 
If so, why take things so seriously in the tavern? 
Look to my Beloved's curls and gaze,

The musicians, the serving maid, and the wine

All the joy of life doesn't matter at all to me, 
Except when my Beloved's beauty shines in it, 
like the Sun. 
The monks and nuns are soaked in the blood of hearts 
they've murdered, 
I pray that one day they cleanse themselves with wine. 
I'm respected at the fire-altars of heathens, 
because the fire that burns forever is within me.

The pucker of your lips transmits a secret truth: 
Thousands of Lovers have fallen deep in this abyss.
Misfortune and and smallness have kept me from you,
I could not reach your embrace soon enough. 
Tell the gatekeeper of the heart

To drink at midnight takes great discipline, 
or in Love's eyes you will be a sinner!" 
O arrogant Priests! Drinkers are not the evil ones,

For there to be Love, selfishness cannot exist. 
Just be True, because Truth makes your words shine.
Insincerity will darken the most beautiful of faces.

Wine has no purpose if the Beloved is not there. 
Alas! 
The Friend is gone and cannot speak with me of the Beloved,

Beware my eyes,

with the same flood of tears and sentiment that drown

The Friend spends his time freely with others, 
But with a stranger like me he keeps hidden.

Come now, don't depend on the house of chance

Come now, don't depend on the house of chance, 
Serve wine to all you see, your life will soon be done. 
I'm the slave of Him, under one sky, 
who is entirely free of all attachment. 
Last night I was in the tavern, 
Drunk and making merry, 
I heard the Djinn bring good news: 
"Ambitious falcon, 
don't think yourself grand for flying high, 
Your nest is a home to sorrow and grief. 
The minaret of heaven cries out: 
"This material trap is too small to be worthy of you"" 
Remember my son; don't fret over sorrows, 
over the passing concerns of what is and may come. 
"enough with your moping!" says the inner voice, 
"Find happiness in the moment, 
for there is nothing else." 
Don't chase after the future or cling to the present, 
Too many have taken this false hag for their bride.
There's no percentage in wanting a rose to bloom forever, 
The heartless nightingale's call lasts only an eve.
And do not envy Hafiz's poetry,

But in me you'll find simplicity and sincerity. 
I can tell my Beloved the secrets

Since I gazed in the beloved's face, 
I can find no greater bliss or happiness. 
The beloved is Mecca,

The nightingale sings its praises. 
Wander through the fields with the book of Love,

"Drinking is wickedness and embezzlement is wrong!"
The wine is Written for you, but not for long. 
Enjoy the wine and the musicians while you can. 
Or worry about looking pious and of good reputation, 
hide from people and the world. 
Being a Priest is good business after all;

In the eye of wisdom, all the goals of this world

Without you my heart aches. 
Only death separates me from the Friend.

A New Rule
 
It is the rule with drunkards to fall upon each other,
to quarrel, become violent, and make a scene.
The lover is even worse than a drunkard.
I will tell you what love is: to enter a mine of gold.
And what is that gold?
The lover is a king above all kings,
unafraid of death, not at all interested in a golden crown.
The dervish has a pearl concealed under his patched cloak.
Why should he go begging door to door?
Last night that moon came along,
drunk, dropping clothes in the street.
&quot;Get up,&quot; I told my heart, &quot;Give the soul a glass of wine.
The moment has come to join the nightingale in the garden,
to taste sugar with the soul-parrot.&quot;
I have fallen, with my heart shattered -
where else but on your path? And I
broke your bowl, drunk, my idol, so drunk,
don't let me be harmed, take my hand.
A new rule a new law has been born:
break all the glasses and fall toward the glassblower.

All Through Eternity
 
All through eternity
Beauty unveils His exquisite form
in the solitude of nothingness;
He holds a mirror to His Face
and beholds His own beauty.
he is the knower and the known,
the seer and the seen;
No eye but His own
has ever looked upon this Universe.
His every quality finds an expression:
Eternity becomes the verdant field of Time and Space;
Love, the life-giving garden of this world.
Every branch and leaf and fruit
Reveals an aspect of His perfection They cypress give hint of His majesty,
The rose gives tidings of His beauty.
Whenever Beauty looks,
Love is also there;
Whenever beauty shows a rosy cheek
Love lights Her fire from that flame.
When beauty dwells in the dark folds of night
Love comes and finds a heart
entangled in tresses.
Beauty and Love are as body and soul.
Beauty is the mine, Love is the diamond.
They have together
since the beginning of time
Side by side, step by step.

Be Lost In The Call
 
Lord, said David, since you do not need us,
why did you create these two worlds?
Reality replied: O prisoner of time,
I was a secret treasure of kindness and generosity,
and I wished this treasure to be known,
so I created a mirror: its shining face, the heart;
its darkened back, the world;
The back would please you if you've never seen the face.
Has anyone ever produced a mirror out of mud and straw?
Yet clean away the mud and straw,
and a mirror might be revealed.
Until the juice ferments a while in the cask,
it isn't wine. If you wish your heart to be bright,
you must do a little work.
My King addressed the soul of my flesh:
You return just as you left.
Where are the traces of my gifts?
We know that alchemy transforms copper into gold.
This Sun doesn't want a crown or robe from God's grace.
He is a hat to a hundred bald men,
a covering for ten who were naked.
Jesus sat humbly on the back of an ass, my child!
How could a zephyr ride an ass?
Spirit, find your way, in seeking lowness like a stream.
Reason, tread the path of selflessness into eternity.
Remember God so much that you are forgotten.
Let the caller and the called disappear;
be lost in the Call.

Be With Those Who Help Your Being
 
Be with those who help your being.

Not these visible forms, your work is deeper.
A chunk of dirt thrown in the air breaks to pieces.
If you don't try to fly,
and so break yourself apart,
you will be broken open by death,

Leaves get yellow. The tree puts out fresh roots

Why are you so content with a love that turns you yellow?

Because I Cannot Sleep
 
Because I cannot sleep
I make music at night.
I am troubled by the one
whose face has the color of spring flowers.
I have neither sleep nor patience,
neither a good reputation nor disgrace.
A thousand robes of wisdom are gone.
All my good manners have moved a thousand miles away.
The heart and the mind are left angry with each other.
The stars and the moon are envious of each other.
Because of this alienation the physical universe
is getting tighter and tighter.
The moon says, 'How long will I remain
suspended without a sun?'
Without Love's jewel inside of me,
let the bazaar of my existence be destroyed stone by stone.
O Love, You who have been called by a thousand names,
You who know how to pour the wine
into the chalice of the body,
You who give culture to a thousand cultures,
You who are faceless but have a thousand faces,
O Love, You who shape the faces
of Turks, Europeans, and Zanzibaris,
give me a glass from Your bottle,
or a handful of being from Your Branch.
Remove the cork once more.
Then we'll see a thousand chiefs prostrate themselves,
and a circle of ecstatic troubadours will play.
Then the addict will be freed of craving.
and will be resurrected,
and stand in awe till Judgement Day.

Bring Wine

Bring wine, for I am suffering crop sickness from the vintage;
God has seized me, and I am thus held fast.
By love’s soul, bring me a cup of wine that is the envy of the
sun, for I care aught but love.
Bring that which if I were to call it “soul” would be a shame,
for the reason that I am pained in the head because of the soul.
Bring that whose name is not contained in this mouth, through
which the fissures of my speech split asunder.
Bring that which, when it is not present, I am stupid and ignorant, but when I am with it, I am the king of the subtle and
crafty ones.
Bring that which, the moment it is void of my head, I become
black and dark, you might say I am of the infidels.
Bring that which delivers out of this “bring” and “do not
bring”; bring quickly, and repel me not, saying, “Whence shall
I bring it?”
Bring, and deliver the roof of the heavens through the long
night from my abundant smoke and lamentations.
Bring that which after my death, even out of my dust, will
restore me to speech and thanksgiving even as Najjar.
Bring me wine, for I am guardian of wine like a goblet, for
whatever has gone into my stomach I deliver back completely.
Najjar said, “After my death would that my people might be
open-eyed to the ecstasy within me.
“They would not regard my bones and blood; in spirit I ama
mighty king, even though in body I am vile.
“What a ladder I, the Carpenter, have chiseled! My going has
reached the roof of the seventh heaven.
“I journeyed like the Messiah, my ass remained below; I do
no grieve for my ass, nor am I asslike of ears.
“Do not like Eblis see in Adam only water and clay; see that
behind the clay are my hundred thousand rose bowers.”
Shams-e Tabrizi rose up from this flesh saying, “ I am the
sun. Bring up my head from this mire.
“Err not, when I enter the mire once more, for I am at rest,

Description Of Love
 
A true lover is proved such by his pain of heart;
No sickness is there like sickness of heart.
The lover's ailment is different from all ailments;
Love is the astrolabe of God's mysteries.
A lover may hanker after this love or that love,
But at the last he is drawn to the KING of love.
However much we describe and explain love,
When we fall in love we are ashamed of our words.
Explanation by the tongue makes most things clear,
But love unexplained is clearer.
When pen hasted to write,
On reaching the subject of love it split in twain.
When the discourse touched on the matter of love,
Pen was broken and paper torn.
In explaining it Reason sticks fast, as an ass in mire;
Naught but Love itself can explain love and lovers!
None but the sun can display the sun,
If you would see it displayed, turn not away from it.
Shadows, indeed, may indicate the sun's presence,
But only the sun displays the light of life.
Shadows induce slumber, like evening talks,
But when the sun arises the 'moon is split asunder.'
In the world there is naught so wondrous as the sun,
But the Sun of the soul sets not and has no yesterday.
Though the material sun is unique and single,
We can conceive similar suns like to it.
But the Sun of the soul, beyond this firmament,
No like thereof is seen in concrete or abstract.
Where is there room in conception for His essence,
So that similitudes of HIM should be conceivable?

Even though in anger you depart a hundred thousand years

Did I not say to you, “Be not content with worldly forms, for I
am the fashioner of the tabernacle of your contentment? ”
Did I not say to you, “I am the sea and you are a single fish;
go not to dry land, for I am your crystal sea? ”
Did I not say to you, “ Go not like birds to the snare; come, for
I am the power of flight and your wings and feet? ”
Did I not say to you, “ They will waylay you and make you

Did I not say to you, “ They will implant in you ugly qualities
so that you will forget that I am the source of purity to you? ”
Did I not say to you, “Do not say from what direction the servant’s affairs come into order? ” I am the Creator without

Pour out the wine for the morning drinkers!
Pour them this subtle and priceless musk!

Every day I bear a burden, and I bear this calamity for a purpose:

Though they expel me from two hundred cities, I bear it for the sake of the love

Though my shop and house be laid waste, I bear it in fidelity to a tulip bed.
God's love is a very strong fortress; I carry my soul's baggage inside a fortress.
I bear the arrogance of every stonehearted stranger for the sake of a friend, of
one long-suffering;
For the sake of his ruby I dig out mountains and mine; for the sake of that roseladen one I endure a thorn.
For the sake of those two intoxicating eyes of his, like the intoxicated I endure
crop sickness;
For the sake of a quarry not to be contained in a snare, I spread out the snare

unsure of every step
lazy and disinterested
keeping a poisonous face
the more this companion waits around

You who are not kept anxiously awake for love's sake, sleep on.

Love's place is out beyond the many separate sects;
since you love choosing and excluding, sleep on.
Love's dawn cup is our sunrise, his dusk our supper;
you whose longing is for sweets and whose passion is for supper, sleep on.
In search of the philosopher's stone, we are melting like copper;
you whose philosopher's stone is cushion and pillow, sleep on.

Here I Am
 
All night, a man called ‘Allah'
Until his lips were bleeding.
Then the Devil said, ‘Hey! Mr Gullible!
How comes you've been calling all night
And never once heard Allah say, ‘Here, I am'?
You call out so earnestly and, in reply, what?
I'll tell you what. Nothing!'
The man suddenly felt empty and abandoned.
Depressed, he threw himself on the ground
And fell into a deep sleep.
In a dream, he met Abraham, who asked,
‘Why are you regretting praising Allah?'
The man said, ‘ I called and called
But Allah never replied, ‘Here I am.'
Abraham explained, ‘Allah has said,
‘Your calling my name is My reply.
Your longing for Me is My message to you.

floating and flying in the will of the air,
often forgetting ever being

I migrate back. I spring loose
from the four-branched, time -and-space cross,

I walk into a huge pasture
I nurse the milk of millennia
Everyone does this in different ways.

may beguile him with wine and a heavy measure.
The arrow of his glance needs not a bow that I should beguile
the shaft of his gaze with a bow.
He is not prisoner of the world, fettered to this world of earth,
that I should beguile him with gold of the kingdom of the world.
He is an angel, though in form he is a man; he is not lustful
that I should beguile him with women.
Angels start away from the house wherein this form is, so how
should I beguile him with such a form and likeness?
He does not take a flock of horses, since he flies on wings; his
food is light, so how should I beguile him with bread?
He is not a merchant and trafficker in the market of the world
that I should beguile him with enchantment of grain and loss.
He is not veiled that I should make myself out sick and utter
sighs, to beguile him with lamentation.
I will bind my head and bow my head, for I have got out of
hand; I will not beguile his compassion with sickness or fluttering.
Hair by hair he sees my crookedness and feigning; what’s
hidden from him that I should beguile him with anything hidden.
He is not a seeker of fame, a prince addicted to poets, that I
should beguile him with verses and lyrics and flowing poetry.
The glory of the unseen form is too great for me to beguile it
with blessing or Paradise.
Shams-e Tabriz, who is his chosen and beloved–perchance I
will beguile him with this same pole of the age.

If A Tree Could Wander 

Oh, if a tree could wander
and move with foot and wings!
It would not suffer the axe blows
and not the pain of saws!
For would the sun not wander
away in every night ?
How could at ev'ry morning
the world be lighted up?
And if the ocean's water
would not rise to the sky,
How would the plants be quickened
by streams and gentle rain?
The drop that left its homeland,
the sea, and then returned ?
It found an oyster waiting
and grew into a pearl.
Did Yusaf not leave his father,
in grief and tears and despair?
Did he not, by such a journey,
gain kingdom and fortune wide?
Did not the Prophet travel
to far Medina, friend?
And there he found a new kingdom
and ruled a hundred lands.
You lack a foot to travel?
Then journey into yourself!
And like a mine of rubies
receive the sunbeams? print!
Out of yourself ? such a journey
will lead you to your self,
It leads to transformation
of dust into pure gold!

If I Weep
 
If I weep, if I come with excuses, my beloved puts cotton wool in his ears.
Every cruelty which he commits becomes him, every cruelty which he commits I
endure.
If he accounts me nonexistent, I account his tyranny generosity.
The cure of the ache of my heart is the ache for him; how shall I not surrender
my heart to his ache?
Only then are glory and respect mine, when his glorious love renders me
contemptible.
Only then does the vine of my body become wine, when the wine-presser stamps
on me and spurns me underfoot.
I yield my soul like grapes under the trampling, that my secret heart may make
merry,
Though the grapes weep only blood, for I am vexed with this cruelty and
tyranny.
He who pounds upon me puts cotton wool in his ears saying, “I do not press
unwittingly.
If you disbelieve, you are excusable, but I am the Abu’l Hikam [the expert] in
this affair.
When you burst under the labor of my feet, then you will render much thanks to
me.”

Laila And The Khalifa.

For whom Majnun lost his head and went distracted?
Thou art not fairer than many other fair ones."
She replied, "Be silent; thou art not Majnun!"
If thou hadst Majnun's eyes,
The two worlds would be within thy view.
Thou art in thy senses, but Majnun is beside himself.
In love to be wide awake is treason.
The more a man is awake, the more he sleeps (to love);
His (critical) wakefulness is worse than slumbering.
Our wakefulness fetters our spirits,
Then our souls are a prey to divers whims,
Thoughts of loss and gain and fears of misery.
They retain not purity, nor dignity, nor lustre,
Nor aspiration to soar heavenwards.
That one is really sleeping who hankers after each whim
And holds parley with each fancy.

Last Night My Soul Cried O Exalted Sphere Of Heaven
 
Last night my soul cried, “O exalted sphere of Heaven, you hang indeed inverted,

“Without sin and crime, eternally revolving upon your body in its complaining is
the indigo of mourning;
“Now happy, now unhappy, like Abraham in the fire; at once king and beggar like
Ebrahim-e Adham.
“In your form you are terrifying, yet your state is full of anguish: you turn round
like a millstone and writhe like a snake.”
Heaven the blessed replied, “How should I not fear that one who makes the
Paradise of the world as Hell?
“In his hand earth is as wax, he makes it Zangi and Rumi , he makes it falcon
and owl, he makes it sugar and poison.
“He is hidden, friend, and has set us forth thus patent so that he may become
concealed.
“How should the ocean of the world be concealed under straws? The straws have
been set adancing, the waves tumbling up and down’
“Your body is like the land floating on the waters of the soul; your soul is veiled
in the body alike in wedding feast or sorrow.
“In the veil you are a new bride, hot-tempered and obstinate; he is railing
sweetly at the good and the bad of the world.
“Through him the earth is a green meadow, the heavens are unresting; on every
side through him a fortunate one pardoned and preserved.
“Reason a seeker of certainty through him, patience a seeker of help through
him, love seeing the unseen through him, earth taking the form of Adam through
him.
“Air seeking and searching, water hand-washing, we Messiah-like speaking, earth
Mary-like silent.
“Behold the sea with its billows circling round the earthy ship; behold Kaabas and
Meccas at the bottom of this well of Zamzam!”

Light Breeze
 
As regards feeling pain, like a hand cut in battle,
consider the body a robe you wear.
When you meet someone you love, do you kiss their clothes? Search out who's

Union with God is sweeter than body comforts.
We have hands and feet different from these. Sometimes in dream we see them.
That is not illusion. It's seeing truly. You do have a spirit body;
don't dread leaving the physical one. Sometimes someone feels this truth so
strongly that he or she can live in mountain solitude totally refreshed.
The worried, heroic doings of men and women seem weary and futile to

Lord, What A Beloved Is Mine!
 
Lord, what a Beloved is mine! I have a sweet quarry; I possess
in my breast a hundred meadows from his reed.
When in anger the messenger comes and repairs towards me,
he says, “Whither are you fleeing? I have business with you.”
Last night I asked the new moon concerning my Moon. The
moon said, “I am running in his wake, my foot is in his dust.”
When the sun arose I said,” How yellow of face you are!” The
sun said, “Out of shame for his countenance I have a face of
gold.”
“Water, you are prostrate, you are running on your head and
face.” Water said, “Because of his incantation I move like a
snake.”
“Noble fire, why do you writhe so?” Fire said, “Because of
the lightning of his face my heart is restless.”
“Wind-messenger of the world, why are you light of heart?”
Wind said, “My heart would burn if the choice were mine.”
“Earth, what are you meditation, silent and watchful?” Earth
said, “Within me I have a garden and spring.”
Pass over these elements, God is our succorer; my head is
aching, in my hand I hold wine.
If you have barred sleep to us, the way of intoxication is open.
Since I have one to assist, he offers wine in both hands.
Be silent, that without this tongue the heart may speak; when
I hear the speech of the heart, I feel ashamed of this speech.

Love
 
Are you fleeing from Love because of a single humiliation?
What do you know of Love except the name?
Love has a hundred forms of pride and disdain,
and is gained by a hundred means of persuasion.
Since Love is loyal, it purchases one who is loyal:
it has no interest in a disloyal companion.
The human being resembles a tree; its root is a covenant with God:
that root must be cherished with all one's might.
A weak covenant is a rotten root, without grace or fruit.
Though the boughs and leaves of the date palm are green,
greenness brings no benefit if the root is corrupt.
If a branch is without green leaves, yet has a good root,
a hundred leaves will put forth their hands in the end.

Reach for the rope of God. And what is that? Putting aside self-will.
Because of willfulness people sit in jail, the trapped bird's wings are tied,
fish sizzle in the skillet.
The anger of police is willfulness. You've seen a magistrate
inflict visible punishment.
Now see the invisible. If you could leave your selfishness, you
would see how you've been torturing your soul. We are born and live inside black
water in a well.
How could we know what an open field of sunlight is?
Don't insist on going where you think you want to go. Ask the way to the spring.

Ode 314
 
Those who don't feel this Love
pulling them like a river,
those who don't drink dawn
like a cup of spring water
or take in sunset like supper,
those who don't want to change,
let them sleep.
This Love is beyond the study of theology,
that old trickery and hypocrisy.
I you want to improve your mind that way,
sleep on.
I've given up on my brain.
I've torn the cloth to shreds
and thrown it away.
If you're not completely naked,
wrap your beautiful robe of words
around you,

Ode 911
 
On the day I die, when I'm being
carried toward the grave, don't weep.
Don't say, ‘He's gone! He's gone!'
Death has nothing to do with going away.
The sun sets and the moon sets,
but they're not gone. Death
is a coming together.
The tomb looks like a prison,
but it's really release
into Union.
The human seed goes down in the ground
like a bucket into the well where Joseph is.
It grows and comes up full
of some unimagined beauty.
Your mouth closes here
and immediately opens
with a shout of joy there.

One Swaying Being
 
Love is not condescension, never
that, nor books, nor any marking
on paper, nor what people say of
each other. Love is a tree with
branches reaching into eternity
and roots set deep in eternity,
and no trunk! Have you seen it?
The mind cannot. Your desiring
cannot. The longing you feel for
this loves comes from inside you.
When you become the Friend, your
longing will be as the man in
the ocean who holds to a piece of
wood. Eventually, wood, man, and
oceans become one swaying being,

One Whisper Of The Beloved
 
Lovers share a sacred decree –
to seek the Beloved.
They roll head over heels,
rushing toward the Beautiful One
like a torrent of water.
In truth, everyone is a shadow of the Beloved –
Our seeking is His seeking,
Our words are His words.
At times we flow toward the Beloved
like a dancing stream.
At times we are still water
held in His pitcher.
At times we boil in a pot
turning to vapor –
that is the job of the Beloved.
He breathes into my ear
until my soul
takes on His fragrance.
He is the soul of my soul –
How can I escape?
But why would any soul in this world
want to escape from the Beloved?
He will melt your pride
making you thin as a strand of hair,
Yet do not trade, even for both worlds,
One strand of His hair.
We search for Him here and there
while looking right at Him.
Sitting by His side we ask,
'O Beloved, where is the Beloved?'
Enough with such questions! –
Let silence take you to the core of life.

Our Death Is Our Wedding With Eternity
 
Our death is our wedding with eternity.
What is the secret? 'God is One.'
The sunlight splits when entering the windows of the house.
This multiplicity exists in the cluster of grapes;
It is not in the juice made from the grapes.
For he who is living in the Light of God,
The death of the carnal soul is a blessing.
Regarding him, say neither bad nor good,
For he is gone beyond the good and the bad.
Fix your eyes on God and do not talk about what is invisible,
So that he may place another look in your eyes.
It is in the vision of the physical eyes
That no invisible or secret thing exists.
But when the eye is turned toward the Light of God
What thing could remain hidden under such a Light?
Although all lights emanate from the Divine Light
Don't call all these lights 'the Light of God';
It is the eternal light which is the Light of God,
The ephemeral light is an attribute of the body and the flesh.
...Oh God who gives the grace of vision!
The bird of vision is flying towards You with the wings of desire.

Reason Says Love Says
 
Reason says, “ I will beguile him with the tongue.”; Love says,
“Be silent. I will beguile him with the soul.”
The soul says to the heart, “Go, do not laugh at me and yourself.
What is there that is not his, that I may beguile him
thereby?”
He is not sorrowful and anxious and seeking oblivion that I
may beguile him with wine and a heavy measure.
The arrow of his glance needs not a bow that I should beguile
the shaft of his gaze with a bow.
He is not prisoner of the world, fettered to this world of earth,
that I should beguile him with gold of the kingdom of the world.
He is an angel, though in form he is a man; he is not lustful
that I should beguile him with women.
Angels start away from the house wherein this form is, so how
should I beguile him with such a form and likeness?
He does not take a flock of horses, since he flies on wings; his
food is light, so how should I beguile him with bread?
He is not a merchant and trafficker in the market of the world
that I should beguile him with enchantment of grain and loss.
He is not veiled that I should make myself out sick and utter
sighs, to beguile him with lamentation.
I will bind my head and bow my head, for I have got out of
hand; I will not beguile his compassion with sickness or fluttering.
Hair by hair he sees my crookedness and feigning; what’s
hidden from him that I should beguile him with anything hidden.
He is not a seeker of fame, a prince addicted to poets, that I
should beguile him with verses and lyrics and flowing poetry.
The glory of the unseen form is too great for me to beguile it
with blessing or Paradise.
Shams-e Tabriz, who is his chosen and beloved–perchance I
will beguile him with this same pole of the age.

Trembling like a leaf and twig from fear of falling, our hearts are throbbing; let us

There is no escape from pain, since we are in exile, and there is no escape from

These forms are signs of the signless fashioner; hidden from the evil eye, come,
let us go to the signless.
It is a road full of tribulation, but love is the guide, giving us instruction how we
should go thereon;
Though the shadow of the king’s grace surely protects, yet it is better that on
that road we go with the caravan.
We are like rain falling on a leaky roof; let us spring from the leak and go by that
waterspout.
We are crooked as a bow, for the string is in our own throats; when we become
straight, then we will go like an arrow from the bow.
We cower like mice in the house because of the cats; if we are lion’s whelps, let
us go to that Lion.
Let us make our soul a mirror in passion for a Joseph; let us go before Joseph’s
beauty with a present.
Let us be silent, that the giver of speech may say this; even as he shall say, so
let us go.

Sleep Of The Body The Soul's Awakening
 
Every night Thou freest our spirits from the body
And its snare, making them pure as rased tablets.
Every night spirits are released from this cage,
And set free, neither lording it nor lorded over.
At night prisoners are unaware of their prison,
At night kings are unaware of their majesty.
Then there is no thought or care for loss or gain,
No regard to such an one or such an one.
The state of the 'Knower' is such as this, even when awake.
God says,4 'Thou wouldst deem him awake though asleep,
Sleeping to the affairs of the world, day and night,
Like a pen in the directing hand of the writer.
He who sees not the hand which effects the writing
Fancies the effect proceeds from the motion of the pen.
If the 'Knower' revealed the particulars of this state,
'Twould rob the vulgar of their sensual sleep.
His soul wanders in the desert that has no similitude;
Like his body, his spirit is enjoying perfect rest;
Freed from desire of eating and drinking,
Like a bird escaped from cage and snare.
But when he is again beguiled into the snare,
He cries for help to the Almighty.

Exuberant is existence, time a husk.
When the moment cracks open, ecstasy leaps out and devours space;
love goes mad with the blessings, like my words give.
Why lay yourself on the torturer's rack of the past and future?
The mind that tries to shape tomorrow beyond its capacities

Be kind to yourself, dear- to our innocent follies.
Forget any sounds or touch you knew that did not help you dance.

The Ravings Which My Enemy Uttered I Heard Within My Heart
 
The ravings which my enemy uttered I heard within my heart;
the secret thoughts he harbored against me I also perceived.
His dog bit my foot, he showed me much injustice; I do not
bite him like a dog, I have bitten my own lip.
Since I have penetrated into the secrets of individuals like men
of God, why should I take glory in having penetrated his secret?
I reproach myself that through my doubtings it so happened
that purposely I drew a scorpion towards my own foot.
Like Eblis who saw nothing of Adam except his fire, by God I
was invisible to his insignificant Eblis.
Convey to my friends why I am afflicted in mind; when the
snake bit my thigh I started away from the black rope.
The blessed silent ones, their lips and eyes closed -by a way
unknown to any man, I ran into their thoughts;
Since there is a secret and perfect way from heart to heart, I
gathered gold and silver from the treasuries of hearts.
Into the thought that was like a brazen stove I flung the dead
dog; out of the thought that was like a rose bower I plucked roses
and jasmine.
If I have hinted at the evil and good ofm y friends, I have spun
flax like a weaver as the choicest veil.
When my heart rushed suddenly to a heart mighty and aware,
out of awe for his heart I fluttered like the heart.
As you are happy with your own state, how did you fall in with
me? Attend to your own business, for I am neither shaikh nor
disciple.
As far as you are concerned, brother, I am neither copper nor
red gold; drive me from your door, for I am neither lock nor key.
Take it as if I had not ever spoken these words; if you had been
in my mind, by God I would not have quarreled.

It no longer has the form it had,

Your Chain
 
The time has come for us to become madmen in your chain, to
burst our bonds and become estranged from all;
To yield up our souls, no more to bear the disgrace of such a

Until we ferment, we shall not escape from this vat of the

flagon and bowl?
Listen to the words from a madman: do not suppose that we
become true men until we die.
It is necessary that we should become more inverted than the
tip of a comb in the top of the twisted tress of felicity;
Spread our wings and pinions like a tree in the orchard, if like
a seed we are to be scattered on this road of annihilation.
Though we are of stone, we shall become like wax for you
seal; though we be candles, we shall become a moth in the track
of your light.
Though we are kings, we shall travel straight as rocks for your
sake, that we may become blessed through your queen on this
chessboard.
In the face of the mirror of love we must not breathe a word of
ourselves; we must become intimate with your treasure when
we are changed to waste.
Like the tale of the heart we must be without bread or ending,
that we may become dwellers in the heart of lovers like a tale.
If he acts like the seeker, we shall attain to being sought; if he acts
the key, we shall become all the wards of the lock.
If Mostafa does not make his way and couch in our hearts, it is

With flowing rhymes and poetic verses?
The glory of his unseen form
Fills the whole universe
How then can I win him
With a mere promise of paradise?
I may cover the earth with roses,
I may fill the ocean with tears,
I may shake the heavens with praises -
none of this will win him.
There is only one way to win him,
this Beloved of mine -
Become his.

Two Friends
 
A certain person came to the Friend's door
and knocked.
'Who's there?'
'It's me.'
The Friend answered, 'Go away. There's no place
for raw meat at this table.'
The individual went wandering for a year.
Nothing but the fire of separation
can change hypocrisy and ego. The person returned
completely cooked,
walked up and down in front of the Friend's house,
gently knocked.
'Who is it?'
'You.'
'Please come in, my self,
there's no place in this house for two.
The doubled end of the thread is not what goes through
the eye of the needle.
It's a single-pointed, fined-down, thread end,
not a big ego-beast with baggage.'

Two Kinds Of Intelligence
 
There are two kinds of intelligence: one acquired,
as a child in school memorizes facts and concepts
from books and from what the teacher says,
collecting information from the traditional sciences
as well as from the new sciences.
With such intelligence you rise in the world.
You get ranked ahead or behind others
in regard to your competence in retaining
information. You stroll with this intelligence
in and out of fields of knowledge, getting always more
marks on your preserving tablets.
There is another kind of tablet, one
already completed and preserved inside you.
A spring overflowing its springbox. A freshness
in the center of the chest. This other intelligence
does not turn yellow or stagnate. It's fluid,
and it doesn't move from outside to inside
through conduits of plumbing-learning.
This second knowing is a fountainhead
from within you, moving out.

Until You'Ve Found Pain
 
Until you've found pain, you won't reach the cure
Until you've given up life, you won't unite with
the supreme soul
Until you've found fire inside yourself, like the Friend,
You won't reach the spring of life, like Khezr.

We Are As The Flute
 
We are as the flute, and the music in us is from thee;
we are as the mountain and the echo in us is from thee.
We are as pieces of chess engaged in victory and defeat:
our victory and defeat is from thee,
O thou whose qualities are comely!
Who are we, O Thou soul of our souls,
that we should remain in being beside thee?
We and our existences are really non-existence;
thou art the absolute Being which manifests the perishable.
We all are lions, but lions on a banner:
because of the wind they are rushing
onward from moment to moment.
Their onward rush is visible,
and the wind is unseen:
may that which is unseen not fail from us!
Our wind whereby we are moved and our being are of thy gift;
our whole existence is from thy bringing into being.

Poem Start
Weary Not Of Us, For We Are Very Beautiful
 
Weary not of us, for we are very beautiful; it is out of very jealousy and proper
pride that we entered the veil.
On the day when we cast of the body’s veil from the soul, you will see that we
are the envy of despair of man and the Polestars.
Wash your face and become clean for beholding us, else remain afar, for we are
beloveds of ourselves.
We are not that beauty who tomorrow will become a crone; till eternity we are
young and heart-comforting and fair of stature.
If that veil become worn out, the beauty has not grown old; the life of the Veil is
transient, and we are boundless life.
When Eblis saw the veil of Adam, he refused; Adam called to him, “You are the
rejected one, not I.”
The rest of the angels fell down prostrate, saying as they bowed themselves, “We
have encountered a beauty:
“Beneath the veil is an idol who by his qualities robbed us of reason, and we,
prostrate, fell.”
If our reason does not know the forms of the foul old men from those of the
beauties, we are apostates from love.
What place is there for a beauty? For he is the Lion of God. Like a child we
prattled, for we are children of the alphabet.
Children are beguiled with nuts and raisins, else, how are we meet for nuts and
sesame-grains?
When an old woman is hidden in helmet and chainmail, she says, “I am the
illustrious Rostam of the battle ranks.”
By her boast all know that she is a woman; how should we make a mistake,
seeing that we are in the light of Ahmad?
“The believer is discriminating” - so said the Prophet; now close your mouth, for
we are guided rightly without speech.
Hear the rest of from Shams the Pride of Tabiz for we did not take the end of the
story from that king.

Poem Start
What Hidden Sweetness Is There
 
What hidden sweetness there is in this emptiness of the belly!
Man is surely like a lute, no more and no less;
For if, for instance, the belly of the lute becomes full, no
lament high or low will arise from that full lute.
If your brain and belly are on fire through fasting, because of
the fire every moment a lament will arise from your breast.
Every moment you will burn a thousand veils by that fire; you
will mount a hundred steps with zeal and endeavor.
Become empty of belly, and weep entreatingly like the reed
pipe; become empty of belly, and tell secrets with the reed pen.
If your belly is full at the time of concourse, it will bring Satan
in place of your reason, an idol in place of the Kaaba.
When you keep the fast, good habits gather together before
you like slaves and servants and retinue.
Keep the fast, for that is Solomon’s ring; give not the ring to
the div, destroy not your kingdom.
Even if your kingdom has gone from your head and your army
has fled, your army will rise up, pennants flying above them.
The table arrived from heaven to the tents of the fast, by the
intervention of the prayers of Jesus, son of Mary.
In the fast, be expectant of the table of bounty, for the table of
bounty is better than the broth of cabbages.

What Was Told, That
 
What was said to the rose that made it open was said
to me here in my chest.
What was told the cypress that made it strong
and straight, what was
whispered the jasmine so it is what it is, whatever made
sugarcane sweet, whatever
was said to the inhabitants of the town of Chigil in
Turkestan that makes them
so handsome, whatever lets the pomegranate flower blush
like a human face, that is
being said to me now. I blush. Whatever put eloquence in
language, that's happening here.
The great warehouse doors open; I fill with gratitude,
chewing a piece of sugarcane,
in love with the one to whom every that belongs!

When Grapes Turn To Wine
 
When grapes turn
to wine, they long for our ability to change.
When stars wheel
around the North Pole,
they are longing for our growing consciousness.
Wine got drunk with us,
not the other way.
The body developed out of us, not we from it.
We are bees,
and our body is a honeycomb.
We made
the body, cell by cell we made it.

When I Am Asleep And Crumbling In The Tomb
 
When I am asleep and crumbling in the tomb, should you come
to visit me, I will come forth with speed.
You are for me the blast of the trumpet and the resurrection,
so what shall I do? Dead or living, wherever you are, there am I.
Without your lip I am a frozen and silent reed; what melodies
I play the moment you breathe on my reed!
Your wretched reed has become accustomed to your sugar lip;
remember wretched me, for I am seeking you.
When I do not find the moon of your countenance, I bind up
my head [veil myself in your mourning]; when I do not find your
sweet lip, gnaw my own hand.

When I Die

When I die
when my coffin
is being taken out
you must never think
i am missing this world
don't shed any tears
don't lament or
feel sorry
i'm not falling
into a monster's abyss
when you see
my corpse is being carried
don't cry for my leaving
i'm not leaving
i'm arriving at eternal love
when you leave me
in the grave
don't say goodbye
remember a grave is
only a curtain
for the paradise behind
you'll only see me
descending into a grave
now watch me rise
how can there be an end
when the sun sets or
the moon goes down
it looks like the end
it seems like a sunset
but in reality it is a dawn
when the grave locks you up
that is when your soul is freed
have you ever seen

when for the last time
you close your mouth
your words and soul

When The Rose Is Gone
 
When the rose is gone and the garden faded

the lover is left like a bird without care,
the lover is left like a bird without wings.

if the light of the Beloved is absent?
Love wills that this Word be brought forth

Zero Circle
 
Be helpless, dumbfounded,
Unable to say yes or no.
Then a stretcher will come from grace
To gather us up.
We are too dull-eyed to see that beauty
If we say we can, we’re lying.
If we say No, we don’t see it,
That No will behead us
And shut tight our window onto spirit.
So let us rather not be sure of anything,
Besides ourselves, and only that, so
Miraculous beings come running to help.
Crazed, lying in a zero circle, mute,
We shall be saying finally,
With tremendous eloquence, Lead us.
When we have totally surrendered to that beauty,
We shall be a mighty kindness.

Listen again. One Evening at the Close
Of Ramazan, ere the better Moon arosc,,
In that old Potter*s Shop I stood alone
With the clay Population round in Rows.

And strange to tell, among that Earthen Lot
Some could articulate, while others not:
And suddcnly one more impaticnt cried
—
"Who is thc Potter, pray, and who the Pot?"

Then said another—"Surely not in vain
My substance from the common Earth was ta'en,
That Hc who subtly wrought me into Shape
Should stamp me back to common Earth again.

Would break thc Bowl from which he drank in
Joy;
Shall He that made the Ycsscl in pure Love
And Fansy, in an aftcr Ragc dcstroy!"
